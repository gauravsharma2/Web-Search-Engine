The feeling of free falling, teaching people to conquer their fears, the beauty of the earth from the distance, nothing will ever thrill you quite like it. It is reassuring that you are more likely to die crossing the road than skydiving, but despite the inherent risks, it is a chance to experience something truly incredible.\n \nAs soon as you touch the earth with your feet you are going to immediately want to do it all over again. So why don’t you? Every day, for a living. \n \nPOTENTIAL EARNINGS\nMost instructors can make between USD $20-$40 per jump, so even with 500 jumps a year you’re probably looking at a salary around $20k/year. You can pad this with video and photography offers. You can build a client base to help increase your salary, and once you have enough experience you can starting your own company or train other instructors.  \n \nHIGH SEASON\nThis is a weather dependent sport, but in most regions you can sky dive year round. \"High\" season is in the mild summer months. It’s always colder at 15,000 feet but people skydive in winter and it can offer some of the best, crystal clear skies. \n \n  HOW TO GET STARTED\n  FEATURED\nModerator 3558 Miles\nLOCATION: London, London, United Kingdom\nMountain Biking\nPaddle / Raft Guides\nOutdoor Education / Camp\nHike / Trek / Mountain Leader\nSki / Snowboard\nRock Climbing / Abseiling\nSky Diving\nBungee Jumping\nPara Gliding\nSurf\nDive\nSnorkel\nKitesurf\nWindsurf\nSail\nWaterski / Wakeboard\nStand Up Paddle\nModerator for Work the Wilds\nVIEW PROFILE\nMESSAGE\nLIKE\n  FEATURED\nGoWild 3558 Miles\nLOCATION: London, London, United Kingdom\nMountain Biking\nPaddle / Raft Guides\nOutdoor Education / Camp\nHike / Trek / Mountain Leader\nSki / Snowboard\nRock Climbing / Abseiling\nSky Diving\nBungee Jumping\nPara Gliding\nSurf\nDive\nSnorkel\nKitesurf\nWindsurf\nSail\nWaterski / Wakeboard\nStand Up Paddle\nAdmin support for Work the Wilds\nVIEW PROFILE\nMESSAGE\nLIKE\n  FEATURED\nEkky\nLOCATION: Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\nMountain Biking\nPaddle / Raft Guides\nOutdoor Education / Camp\nHike / Trek / Mountain Leader\nSki / Snowboard\nRock Climbing / Abseiling\nSky Diving\nBungee Jumping\nPara Gliding\nSurf\nDive\nSnorkel\nKitesurf\nWindsurf\nSail\nWaterski / Wakeboard\nStand Up Paddle\nInterested in all Work in the outdoors\nVIEW PROFILE\nMESSAGE\nLIKE\nromaincollin 3055 Miles\nLOCATION: france, , France\nRock Climbing / Abseiling\nSki / Snowboard\nSky Diving\nKitesurf\nStand Up Paddle\nSurf\nWaterski / Wakeboard\nPassionate about business, strategy, analysis i have combine work passion and sport passion . surf as grab me since almost 15 years and as bring to many place for traveling and now working . my last job been in Maldives as director of operation and surf coach for \"taylor made\" courses .

It will probably take about 1-2 months to become a licensed pilot and then a few years to refine your skills and become an instructor. \n \nPOTENTIAL EARNINGS\nPeople joke that this is a volunteer sport, and you may just break even after you buy all your equipment, but if you do what you love…\n \nDepending on the company you might earn $25/hr for ground instruction or $35/hr for flying.  You can earn a lot per hour, but if the weather fails, there is no work, so income is unsteady, at best. This is not a job to get rich, and you may need to have another job to support yourself.\n \nHIGH SEASON\nIn this sport flying in low season may be as important to your skills as high season when you can earn more money. Air Pressure and Air Currents vary so much from month to month (and day to day) in each region. We suggest you get in touch with local and regional clubs for the best information.

When you are skydiving, and about to jump in, it doesn’t look real. It looks like a satellite image or a cloud. But when you bungee jump in, it all looks real. The water, the rocks, the ground is real and it is close. You may have a jump face to face with a sheer mountain face. It is an exhilarating experience to jump in, attached at only the ankles. You’ve got to have faith and an ability to overcome fear. \n \nPOTENTIAL EARNINGS\nOnce trained as a Bungee Jump Master, potential earnings can be between $12-20 USD per hour or $25-$35k/year. Many companies offer zip line to customers, but the ‘role’ will probably ‘rolled’ into the same wage. \n \nHIGH SEASON\nEurope –  May-October but some provide year round jumps\nNorth America – Year round        \nSouth America – Year round\nAustralia/New Zealand – Year round     \nAsia – Mostly year round but stay clear of Monsoon seasons\nAfrica – Year round\n \n  HOW TO GET STARTED\n  FEATURED\nModerator 3558 Miles\nLOCATION: London, London, United Kingdom\nMountain Biking\nPaddle / Raft Guides\nOutdoor Education / Camp\nHike / Trek / Mountain Leader\nSki / Snowboard\nRock Climbing / Abseiling\nSky Diving\nBungee Jumping\nPara Gliding\nSurf\nDive\nSnorkel\nKitesurf\nWindsurf\nSail\nWaterski / Wakeboard\nStand Up Paddle\nModerator for Work the Wilds\nVIEW PROFILE\nMESSAGE\nLIKE\n  FEATURED\nGoWild 3558 Miles\nLOCATION: London, London, United Kingdom\nMountain Biking\nPaddle / Raft Guides\nOutdoor Education / Camp\nHike / Trek / Mountain Leader\nSki / Snowboard\nRock Climbing / Abseiling\nSky Diving\nBungee Jumping\nPara Gliding\nSurf\nDive\nSnorkel\nKitesurf\nWindsurf\nSail\nWaterski / Wakeboard\nStand Up Paddle\nAdmin support for Work the Wilds\nVIEW PROFILE\nMESSAGE\nLIKE\n  FEATURED\nEkky\nLOCATION: Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\nMountain Biking\nPaddle / Raft Guides\nOutdoor Education / Camp\nHike / Trek / Mountain Leader\nSki / Snowboard\nRock Climbing / Abseiling\nSky Diving\nBungee Jumping\nPara Gliding\nSurf\nDive\nSnorkel\nKitesurf\nWindsurf\nSail\nWaterski / Wakeboard\nStand Up Paddle\nInterested in all Work in the outdoors\nVIEW PROFILE\nMESSAGE\nLIKE\nAnna 3054 Miles\nLOCATION: Millau, , France\nRock Climbing / Abseiling\nBungee Jumping\nHi!

You probably don’t need a high school diploma but you will need to be a member of the National Parachute Association in your region and log a set number of jumps and hours of freefall. There are several levels of skydiving professionals; coach, instructor, examiner, pro and judge. Each certification tests your knowledge, skill and experience.\n \nSelect a region on the left for more information by location. You can message an employer on Work the Wilds to ask what they would accept. Find an employer HERE .

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to become a skydiving instructor in Australia:\n \nStep 1: Meet the Basic Requirements To become a skydiving instructor in Australia, you must meet certain basic requirements. You must be at least 18 years old and have a valid skydiving license issued by the Australian Parachute Federation (APF). You must also have completed a minimum of 500 jumps and have at least three years of skydiving experience.\n \nStep 2: Obtain the Necessary Certifications To become a skydiving instructor, you need to have certain certifications.

You'll gain experience in teaching proper technique, safety procedures, and communication with students.\n \nStep 4: Become a Solo Instructor Once you have enough experience as a tandem instructor, you can start working towards becoming a solo instructor. This involves passing a further examination by the APF that tests your skills in solo skydiving techniques, safety procedures, and teaching methods. You'll also need to log a minimum of 750 jumps, including at least 50 jumps within the past six months.\n \nStep 5: Get Hired as a Skydiving Instructor After obtaining your certifications and gaining experience, it's time to apply for jobs as a skydiving instructor. You can apply to work at a skydiving school or club, or even start your own business. Most skydiving schools require instructors to have liability insurance, so make sure you have this in place before starting work.

Here's what you need to know to get started:\n \n1. Get certified: To become a skydive instructor, you'll need to be certified by the Canadian Sport Parachuting Association (CSPA). This involves completing a series of courses and obtaining the necessary experience and qualifications. You'll need to start with the basic skydiving course, progress to advanced courses, and finally earn your instructor rating.\n \n2. Gain experience: Before you can become an instructor, you'll need to log a certain number of jumps and demonstrate your skills and knowledge of the sport. The CSPA requires a minimum of 500 jumps before you can apply for an instructor rating, although many skydive centers prefer instructors with significantly more experience.\n \n3. Complete the instructor course: Once you've met the requirements for experience and qualifications, you'll need to complete the CSPA's Instructor Course. This course includes both classroom instruction and practical training, and covers topics such as teaching methods, safety procedures, and emergency protocols.\n \n4. Pass the exams: To become a certified instructor, you'll need to pass both a written exam and a practical evaluation. The written exam covers the material you learned in the instructor course, while the practical evaluation involves demonstrating your ability to teach and supervise students.\n \n5. Get hired: Once you've earned your instructor rating, you'll need to find a skydive center that is hiring instructors. You may need to start out as an assistant instructor or work part-time before you can land a full-time job, but with dedication and hard work, you can build a rewarding career as a skydive instructor. You can use Work the Wilds to connect with Employers and search jobs. \n \nBecoming a skydive instructor requires a lot of dedication, hard work, and passion for the sport. But for those who are up to the challenge, it can be an incredibly rewarding career that allows you to share your love of skydiving with others while enjoying the thrill of the jump yourself.
