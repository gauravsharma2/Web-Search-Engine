The squad is for divers aged 10 – 11 years of age at the point of selection.\nDivers follow a journey over an 18 month period. Team Z will complete seven weekend-based camps. These are focused around developing divers technically and physically by building on the fundamental skills demonstrated at the Games.\nEach camp has a defined technical theme that has been established to assist a diver in transition from skills to elite diving over the 18 month period.\nThe Team Z camps are spaced throughout the season to provide opportunity for divers to develop core skills and demonstrate progression from camp to camp.\nIn addition to the technical themes (Forward and Inward Rotation, Back and Reverse Rotation, Twisting and Bouncing Skills), the camps will provide a detailed physical diving development programme with a strong focus on acrobatic skills and gymnastic conditioning.\nThe programme aims to prepare each diver for the Junior Elite Championships at the end of the 18 months.\nNational Squad\nDivers in the National Squad (Team Y) are selected from the National Assessment Camp and are between 12 and 15 years old.\nTo be considered for invitation to the National Assessment Camp, a diver must have first competed at the GB Junior Elites.\nThe Assessment Camp will typically run in September at the start of the season.\nSelection to the squad will require a pass in a number of technical and physical areas:\nPerformance GB Junior Elites – Invited to join the camp\nPhysical Testing (Gymnastic Routine + Physical Tests).\nPhysio Assessment\nEntry Test – consistency\nBouncing skills test 3m – consistency, awareness & control\nRequired dive test platform OR springboard (six dives) – group fundamentals\nSquad staff observations\nTalent Athlete Scholarship Programme (TASS)\nTASS is the top tier of the England Talent Programme.\nDivers aged 16+ who make the ‘B’ qualification standard for European Junior Championships at the Junior Elite Championships or achieve the performance matrix at a Senior Championships who are not on World Class Podium Potential are invited to the England Programmes TASS Assessment Camp.\nThey must complete a slightly different set of skills to be considered for selection.\nFor the parents of athletes\nThe England Programmes Talent Pathway appreciates the high commitment level from diving parents.\nAt each level of the programme, there are parent engagement sessions that aim to help the elite diving parent support the needs of a developing athlete.\nSessions include:\nUnderstanding the pathway\nPerformance nutrition\nWorking with education\nPerformance lifestyle\nSupportive parenting\nDevelopment\nDevelopment\nPopular Content on the Hub\nFind A Diving Club\nThe Rules of Diving and Divers\nDiving Development\nDiving Results\nDiving Competitions\nPathway Coach Programme 2022-2023\n© Copyright 2024\nSwimming.org\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nCookie Policy\nSwim England Jobs\nWebsite by Skylab Website by Skylab\nTop\n"},

Swim England and British Diving have developed a multi-level competition programme on both local and national level.\nDiving competitions are skill-focused. To become a successful diver, athletes must have a complete diving skill set rather than just being able to perform a couple of dives.\nThe best way to get in to diving competitions is through a club. If you haven’t yet joined a diving club find out more here .\nIf you are new to diving and want to find out more about the competitions which take place see the drop downs below.\nOr, head over to our national events calendar for a large list of diving competitions which take place throughout the year.\n4 Levels of Diving Competitions in England\nSkills Competitions\nThe Talent Games\nRegional and Club Competitions\nNational Competitions\nSkills Competitions\nSkills competitions are the first level of competitive diving. They involve testing basic skills from the poolside, 1m springboard and 3m springboard.\nDivers will be tested on the ‘rip’ they perform and their controlled take-offs.\nThe Talent Games\nChildren from either the Schools Talent ID scheme or regular Learn To Dive beginnings whose clubs have identified as having potential are prepared in a broad range of technical and physical events. Their training will be a mix of:\ngymnastic training\ntechnical dry dive training\nphysical preparation\ndive training.\nChildren 11 years and under will compete for their clubs at the Talent Games. Each year the top divers will be selected for the England Programmes Zone Squad .\nRegional And Club Competitions\nThe Swim England regions and clubs provide a number of competitions for divers who at this level will be undertaking between four and six training sessions per week. The sessions are between 2 – 3 hours long.\nThe main focus of age group diving must be physical and technical development. Learning complex diving skills is not a priority, but a strong competency in all of the diving groups . Gaining strong competency is essential before transition to elite competitive development.\nTraining sessions for divers at this level will often be split. 50% of their time will be spent on dry based technical and physical preparatory work and 50% water based activity developing dives.\nNational Diving Competitions\nThere are plenty of opportunities for the best divers in England and Great Britain to take on their contemporaries on the domestic stage.\nThe British Diving Championships is the highest level of competition and regularly features the likes of Tom Daley , Jack Laugher and Tonia Couch as they fine-tune their preparation for the summer’s major championships.\nThe other top senior competition is the National Cup which often kicks off the season, traditionally taking place in Southend.\nThere are two national level junior events on the domestic calendar – the British Elite Junior Diving Championships and the Swim England Diving National Age Group Championships.\nThe standard to enter the British Junior Elites is the highest and the British team for the European Junior Championships is often selected from results at this event.\nMeanwhile, the Swim England Diving National Age Group Championships is the pinnacle of national competition for age group divers in England – click here to find out more on the official event website.\nAlternatively, head to our Results page for more information about these national competitions.\nAre there eligibility restrictions for national diving competitions?\nOnce an athlete has competed at the Swim England Diving National Age Group Champs, they become ineligible – except in certain circumstances – to compete at the Swim England Diving National Skills Finals, the step below NAGs.\nSimilarly, divers who have competed at either the British Diving Championships or the British Elite Junior Diving Championships are ineligible to compete at a NAG Champs.\nWhat are the age groups at diving competitions?\nYou may have seen reference to Groups A, B, C, D and E at various levels of junior diving competition in the UK and abroad.\nThese groups reflect the ages of divers competing in that event and are commonly used in England, including at the National Age Group Championships and National Skills Finals.\nDiving age groups are established from a diver’s age on 31 December of the year of competition.\nNational Age Group Championships groups:\nGroup A – 16 / 17 / 18 Yrs\nGroup B – 14 / 15 Yrs\nGroup C – 12 / 13 Yrs\nGroup D – 9 / 10 / 11 Yrs\nNational Skills Finals groups:\nGroup A – 16 / 17 / 18 Yrs\nGroup B – 14 / 15 Yrs\nGroup C2 – 13 Yrs\nGroup C1 – 12 Yrs\nGroup D2 – 11 Yrs\nGroup D1 – 10 Yrs\nGroup E – 8 / 9 Yrs\nDiving Competitions in England\nPopular Content on the Hub\nFind A Diving Club\nThe Rules of Diving and Divers\nDiving Development\nDiving Results\nDiving Competitions\nPathway Coach Programme 2022-2023\nUpcoming Diving Events\n27 June 2024\nGoCardless Swim England Diving National Age Group Championships 2024\nThu 27 Jun - Sun 30 Jun\nNational, West Midlands\nCompetitions, Diving, Events and Competitions, Swim England\n13 July 2024\nSwim England Diving National Skills Finals\nSat 13 Jul - Sun 14 Jul\nEast, National\nCompetitions, Diving, Events and Competitions, Swim England\n1\n© Copyright 2024\nSwimming.org\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nCookie Policy\nSwim England Jobs\nWebsite by Skylab Website by Skylab\nTop\n"},

I feel really happy, I’m enjoying it and that’s the main thing.”\nNoah added: “It’s a lot of fun, I’m very happy [with where we’re at]. The last week and a half training with Tom has gone really well.\n“We didn’t put in our best performance today, but it would still be good enough to do that at a World Champs, so I’m happy with everything right now.”\nWilliams added to that success with an individual gold in the Men’s Platform final.\nHe came out on top in a back and forth final with Kyle Kothari with the Dive London duo trading places throughout the competition.\nBut it was the consistency of Williams that gave him the edge with five 80+ point dives before a massive 105.45 in the final round for his Forward 4 1/2 Somersault Tuck saw him win the gold with a total of 520.45.\nKothari broke the 90 point barrier for two of his dives as he hit a total of more than 500 for the first time to finish as the runner up.\nAndrea’s double\nAndrea Spendolini-Sirieix received tens from the judges as she soared to Women’s Platform gold.\nHer final dive of a Back 2 1/2 Somersaults 1 1/2 Twists Pike scored 89.60 from the judges to see her hit an overall score of 393.50.\nSpendolini-Sirieix’s synchro partner Lois Toulson was second with 340.20 whilst Eden Cheng completing the podium with 314.45.\nIt marked both Spendolini-Sirieix and Toulson’s second medal of the week after they teamed for gold in the Women’s Platform Synchronised final on the opening day.\nThe duo scored a new personal best as a pair with a tally of 317.10 for the world silver medallists.\nAnother pair of world silver medallists who returned to the top step in Edinburgh were Jack Laugher and Anthony Harding.\nThe duo – who secured a second successive world silver in the summer – closed out their year with a score of 437.88 points.\nJames Heatly and Ross Haslam teamed up for second place whilst the young duo of Connor Lano and Todd Geggus claimed British bronze.\nCity of Sheffield diver, Haslam, did become champion in the Men’s 1m Springboard however.\nA composed performance saw the European Games gold medallist secure the title with 400.70.\nJust 5.70 points separated the top three in the Men’s 3m Springboard final.\nDaniel Goodfellow, Jack Laugher and Jordan Houlden put on an incredible show for the crowd as they battled it out for the national title.\nGoodfellow and Laugher traded places throughout the competition but with the decisive final dive, London’s Goodfellow scored 84.60 from the judges to edge out Laugher for the title by just 1.45 points.\nHoulden significantly closed the gap on the pair in the final two rounds but he had to settle for bronze despite his efforts with a final score of 470.30.\nThe final winning total was 476.00.\nYou can find all the results from the competition on DiveRecorder and you can see all the medallists for the event with our roll of honour below.\nImage credit: Bruce White/Scottish Swimming\nMedal Roll of Honour for the British National Cup 2023\nMen’s 1m Final\n1, Ross Haslam, City of Sheffield, 400.70\n2.

The best way to continue your journey in your star sport and learn from great professionals.\nOur diving school is located in the heart of the Costa Blanca , a perfect location for our activity and of course, for anyone who shares our passion to come and learn to dive. at the level you want, in this case with the Basic Diver course. The two dives that we will normally do will be off the coast of Alicante or Murcia, depending on the weather conditions on the chosen day. In any case, spectacular areas to dive.\nThis course is suitable for beginners or for those who have never done it in open water, in fact both scuba dives are at sea. In the first one, at less depth, we will learn more basic techniques, the operation of the material, control over it and to advance little by little to acquire that confidence that we are looking for.\nWe will go up to the surface to change bottles, rest a bit and hydrate ourselves to gain strength for the second part. The next dive will be at a maximum depth of 12 meters . It will be in this when you really realize the wonders that the bottom of the sea hides, being able to swim among spectacular marine vegetation and the odd school of curious fish. It goes without saying that respect for nature for us goes above all else, so learning to value it is also part of our learning.\nAlthough it is an activity that can be carried out by almost anyone, as for minors, we do make some adaptations in terms of immersions:\nIf the minor is between 10 and 11 years old, it will be done at a maximum depth of 6 meters.\nIn case of being over 12 years old, this will be done at a maximum of 12 meters.\nOnce again on the surface, we will chat about the curiosities of the sea, the fish and plants among which we have dived. It will be a pleasant moment that will make us aware of how exciting diving is.\nOnce you receive your SSI certificate and a diploma from our school, you will be able to continue your journey within the world of buco as you had wished, and in just 6 hours !\nDiving Spain Diving Comunidad Valenciana Diving Alicante Diving Santa Pola\nWhat does the activity include\nTheory\n2 sea dives\nDiving equipment\nSSI Certificate\nInsurance\nHow long the activity lasts\nThe diving course lasts one morning, about 6 hours in total.\nWhen your activity starts and finishes\nFrom 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.\nTransport\nRound trip transfer from the dive center to the place where we do the dives.\nMinimum age\n10 years\nYumping is committed to you\nHow does it work?\nPurchase the activity with Fixed Date.\nGet the activity with Open Date.

EPA/Dennis M Sabangan\nNot making a splash: the anatomy of a perfect Olympic dive\nPublished: July 30, 2012 12:17am EDT\nSian Barris , Queensland University of Technology\nAuthor\nSian Barris\nPostgraduate research student, exercise, Queensland University of Technology\nDisclosure statement\nSian Barris receives a PhD scholarship from the Australian Institute of Sport, Queensland University of Technology and Diving Australia.\nPartners\nQueensland University of Technology provides funding as a member of The Conversation AU.\nView all partners\nEmail\nX (Twitter)\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nMessenger\nDiving is one of the most graceful and spectacular sports in the world, and every four years, at the Olympics, it captures the attention of audiences worldwide. So what goes into the perfect dive?\nDiving is physically demanding, requiring stamina and strength as well as speed, agility and flexibility to perform an incredible range of somersaults, pikes, and twists.\nMany changes have occurred in competitive diving since its inclusion in the modern Olympics in 1904. Springboards which were once rigid wooden planks sloping upwards have undergone a radical transformation into tapered and perforated aluminium alloy boards mounted level and fitted with moveable fulcrums.\nTraining methods have become more sophisticated, with an emphasis on dry-land exercises and drills. The difficulty of dives performed in competition have also steadily increased during the last 30 years.\nWhere once, only a few elite competitors were capable of performing a forward 1½ somersault VID, dives such as a forward 4½ somersault are now being performed routinely. The video below, of Australian diver Ethan Warren , shows the front 4½ somersault being performed almost to perfection.\nBut just how do these athletes launch themselves from towers or springboards and disappear beneath the water with almost no splash?\nAt the moment of take-off from the platform or springboard, two critical aspects of the dive are determined, and cannot subsequently be altered during the execution. One is the trajectory of the dive, and the other is the magnitude of the angular momentum .\nBecause the initial conditions of the flight, specifically, the angle of projection at take-off, velocity of the centre of mass, and angular momentum, are established during the take-off, this phase plays a major role in determining the outcome of the dive.\nDuring the take-off, divers must produce sufficient vertical momentum for the flight of the dive, adequate horizontal momentum to clear the take-off surface and enough angular momentum to execute the required number of twists and/or somersaults.\nThe success of the dive is determined by a combination of the divers’ position at last contact with the take-off surface and the magnitude and direction of the forces and that have been applied during the take-off phase.\nConsequently, the success of a dive is largely dependent on the actions of the diver before they leave the take-off surface.\nAustralian Olympic divers Matthew Mitcham, Rachel Bugg (left) and Brittany Broben practice a dive in Brisbane on Tuesday, May 29, 2012 after they were named as team members for the 2012 London Games.\nDan Peled/AAP\nIn the air, most dives are performed in a tucked or piked position. The tucked position is the most compact (body folded up in a tight ball, hands holding the shins and toes pointed), and as such, gives the diver the most control over rotational speed. Dives in this position, are therefore, easier to perform.\nIn a piked position the moment of inertia is larger (as the body has an increased radius) and consequently, the dives tend to have a higher degree of difficulty.\nAs the diver completes the required number of somersaults or twists, they open the body out ready for entry into the water. The action of opening out and changing body position does not stop the diver’s rotation, but merely slows it down.\nThe vertical entry achieved by expert divers is largely an illusion created by starting the entry slightly short of vertical, so that the legs are vertical as they disappear beneath the surface.\nA good entry into the water in competitive diving is one which appears to be “splash-less”, is accompanied by a characteristic “rip” sound, and simulates the sound of tearing paper.\nThe rip entry , considered the “hallmark of a master” looks to a viewer as if the diver is being sucked into the water without a splash.\nAustralian Matthew Mitcham completed an Olympic-gold-winning “back 2½ somersault with 2½ twists in the pike position” at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. It’s an exemplary dive, with all of the characteristics mentioned above. You can watch it in this video at 1 minute 55 seconds in.\nTo achieve a rip entry, the diver’s arms must be extended forwards in line with the ears, the elbows must be locked and the stomach and back of the diver must be tight.\nOne hand grabs the other with palms facing down to strike the water with a flat surface. Impact with the water creates a vacuum between the hands, arms and head which, as the diver enters vertically, pulls any splash down and under the water with the diver until they are deep enough (1-2m) to have minimal effect on the surface of the water.\nAustralian Institute of Sport dry-land training centre.\nTo be successful at international competitions, divers must be able to perform high degree-of-difficulty dives with reasonable consistency. To develop these skills, Australia’s top divers - among them Sharleen Stratton, Ethan Warren, Anabelle Smith and Brittany Broben - train 28-30 hours per week and split their time between the dry-land facility and the pool.\nThe dry-land training environment is a purpose built gymnasium next to the aquatic centre designed for land-based diving practice. The divers use this centre to warm up, for strength and conditioning skills, and to part-practise diving skills, where they can isolate small parts of the skill and practise them independently.\nThis might be the take-off and initial somersault before landing feet first on the mat or in the pit. In the pool, divers complete both feet first and traditional wrist first entries into the water.\nTraining programmes are written for each individual diver for each training session and cover basic water entries (to correct technique), take-off skills, compulsory dives (lower degree of difficulty dives performed in the preliminary rounds at competitions) and optional dives (dives with a higher degree of difficulty performed in competition).\nBetween each repetition, the athletes receive external feedback from the coach and delayed video replays of their performance from multiple angles, allowing them analyse their dives and constantly fine-tune the execution of these complex skills.\nBut these athletes don’t do it alone. Behind the divers are a team of dedicated coaches and support staff (trainers, psychologists, dieticians and analysts), who equally commit as many hours to training, sharing their experience and expertise to help these athlete in the pursuit of gold in London.\nAustralian Olympic divers team (front row L to R) Anabelle Smith, Rachel Bugg, Jaele Patrick, Brittany Broben, Sharleen Stratton, Melissa Wu and Loudy Wiggins and (back row L to R:) Matthew Mitcham, James Connor and Ethan Warren.\nDan Peled/AAP\nLondon Olympics\nWant to write?\nWrite an article and join a growing community of more than 182,600 academics and researchers from 4,945 institutions.\nRegister now\nEditorial Policies\nCommunity standards\nRepublishing guidelines\nFriends of The Conversation\nAnalytics\nOur feeds\nDonate\nGet newsletter\nWho we are\nOur charter\nOur team\nPartners and funders\nResource for media\nContact us\nEn Español\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPrivacy policy\nTerms and conditions\nCorrections\nCopyright © 2010–2024, The Conversation US, Inc.\n"},

I am walking the same way as the ancient royal person,\" Bowshire said.\nImage Source: Marie-Eve Marleau competing for Canada in the Women's 10m Platform Final at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games (Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)\nFor Marie-Eve Marleau, Sports Manager Diving and High Diving of World Aquatics, had competed in Xi'an in 2008 personally when she was a diver and always had special feeling to Xi'an.\n\"We were invited to the City Wall during the Grand Welcome Ceremony and everybody was really grateful. Because we do hotel-pool and pool-hotel all the time and we don't have that much time to absorb the culture of the cities we visit,\" Marleau said.\nThe opening show before the final everyday is full of cultural recreational elements. The light shadow of 3D animation projection over the swimming pool, which is covered with huge white cloth as the big screen, Qin opera combined with the magnificent drum array, call for the resonance from past to the modern.\nImage Source: Tom Daley and Noah Williams of Great Britain pose with their silver medals and event mascot Tang Niu after the Men's Synchronised 10m Platform Final from the World Aquatics Diving World Cup 2024 in Xi'an (Wang He/Getty Images)\nTang Niu, the mascot of a little chubby girl image, is the most-wanted one by all the divers. It is based on the Terra-cottar women of the Tang Dynasty, retaining the makeup features and combining the features of modern comics.\n\"I like the mascot Tang Niu very much. It is cute and full of Xi'an local culture element. My doll collection has one more character,\" smiled Chinese diving superstar Quan Hongchan, whose bag is covered with at least 30 doll pendants.\nCanadian women's 10m platform diver Caeli Mckay likes the mascot very much, saying, \"It is so soft and cute! \" \n\"We got the mascot of Tang Niu which is awesome, probably the best one that we've got. It is in Tang style!” said Maddison Keeney of Australia after they claimed victory in the women's 3m Springboard Synchro on Friday. “I want to try on the Tang clothes and make-up to take pictures to my family and friends after my event.”\nGreat Britain's star diver Thomas Daley was delighted to bring the two mascot he collected from the men's 10m synchro platform and mixed team to his sons. \"I would like to bring it back to my sons!

That's quite amazing to know that as world aquatics for diving, it is such a popular sport in China,” said Marleau, the Sports Manager Diving and High Diving of World Aquatics.\n“I've noticed not only the fans and the spectators are cheering for the Chinese, but they're cheering for everybody. We can see banners from other divers like Thomas Daley in the audience stands,” Marleau added.\nBashar Alsaffar, Diving Technical Committee Chairperson, said: “I really appreciate that we found the love for diving from the spectators here in China.”\nThe full-house audience in Xi’an made divers excited and full of power.\n“The audience is always great in China that everybody turns out and shows up. And it's really nice to be able to dive in front of a huge crowd,\"Daley said after his silver-medal performance with his partner Noah Williams in the men’s 10m platform synchro final.  \nImage Source: Wang He/Getty Images\nWang Zongyuan, champion in the men’s 3m springboard, said: “It was the full-house crowds who boosted my fighting spirit and brave heart to cool down myself in the following rounds.” \nAnja Zeindl, a long-time German fan of diving, reserved her hotel room in Xi’an five months ago and booked whole tickets package for all six competition sessions. “I was in previous stops in Montreal and Berlin before I came to Xi’an this year. I’d love to cheer up for all the divers as a whole!

Now I'm looking forward to getting into the next competition, which will be the Paris Olympic Games. The audience is always great in China that everybody turns out and shows up.

Not only does freediving give you the ability to connect with the ocean and other bodies of water, but it can teach you mindfulness, body awareness, and can connect you to an incredible community of like-minded people with common interests. We interviewed 4 competitive freedivers on the US National Team who are competing in the Masters category (freedivers over the age of 50) at the Confédération Mondiale Des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS) Freediving Depth World Championships. Read on to hear their perspectives about aging and how it relates to freediving.\nMeet the Athletes\nAvi Kleyman  is a 54 year-old who began his interest in underwater activities through scuba diving and underwater photography. He began freediving at the age of 50 when his friend invited him to take a freediving course based in LA and on Catalina Island. Initially, Avi was skeptical. “I thought that it would be a boring past time because you can’t stay underwater very long. You just go up and down on a line. What’s the fun? However, when I did the course, I got addicted. I got the freediving bug in my blood.” While Avi’s primary area of interest is competitive freediving, he still has a passion for underwater photography and spearfishing, which he enjoys because he can eat fresh fish that is caught in a conscious and responsible manner.  \nJanine Cianciolo is a 63 year-old veterinarian based in Florida who works with exotic animals and marine life. In addition, she works at a clinic to provide emergency veterinary care for the animals of disadvantaged populations. When asked about how she got into her profession, Janine replied, “I’ve always been around animals my whole life. I dealt with a lot of challenges while growing up and…I realized just how important the human-animal bond is.” While Janine has been scuba diving for a significant portion of her life, she turned to freediving at the age of 61. “At that time in my life, there were some major traumas going on, and scuba diving wasn’t relaxing enough for me. One of my friends said that I should try freediving, so I took a freediving class and just fell in love with it. The whole mindfulness and inward focus…it just resonated with me.” Now, Janine is an instructor for scuba diving, freediving, and mermaiding courses. In addition to teaching these courses professionally, Janine reports that she enjoys freediving so she can “stay down longer with the little critters.” She enjoys using her freediving background to work on conservation projects in Florida.\nAlasdair Boyd  is a 65 year-old freediver based in Los Angeles. He was raised in Ireland and England, lived in South Africa, and then came to the United States at the age of 28. He has worked in a broad variety of fields including skydiving, work with defense contractors, and now in the entertainment business as a location scout and manager. Alasdair was originally inspired to take his first freediving course due to a radio interview he heard with Adam Skolnick, the author of a book about competitive freediving called One Breath. In an effort to find others to freedive with, Alasdair started a snorkeling meetup group. As the group grew, they moved the forum to an active freediving group on Facebook with over 700 members that has blossomed into what is now known as the Southern California Freedive Buddy Network , where freedivers can find buddies to dive or train with, or aspiring freedivers can connect with instructors and mentors. At this point, Alasdair identifies as a “weekend warrior” freediver, and his areas of interest involve fun diving on local reefs, line diving with training buddies, and participating in the occasional freediving competition.  \nJennifer Brant is a 56 year-old freediver based in Hawaii. She got her start in underwater activities through swimming, cave diving, working as a scuba instructor, and working as support and safety for the mermaid performers of the Weeki Wachee springs in Florida. She discussed with us how she had the opportunity to wear a mermaid tail through her involvement with the underwater shows, and she fell in love with freediving when she got to dive with a monofin. She took her first freediving course in her mid-forties, and since then, her areas of interest in freediving have evolved to include diving for personal enjoyment, competing in freediving competitions as an athlete, supporting competitions as a judge, and advocating for freediving safety. She is on the board of directors for Freedive Safe Hawaii , which is a nonprofit that uses grant money to provide free safety training for children and young adults, ages 12 to 25, who freedive and spearfish in the Hawaiian Islands. They aim to reduce ocean deaths related to drowning and spearfishing accidents by presenting in Hawaiian public schools to reach as many people as possible.\nPerspectives on Age in Relation to Freediving\nAvi: In the few years that Avi has been freediving, he has reported a quick and steady progression in depth. “Freediving is one of the sports that can be done pretty much at any age. At some point, I may not have the energy or it may be more risky to go very deep, but I don’t know why I waited so long to get certified.” While the colder waters off of the California Coast don’t phase Avi, he discusses how he is shifting his objective from not just diving deep, but to dive to a target depth consistently through the refinement of his technique. When asked about how freediving has benefitted him, Avi described an improvement in his physical fitness, agility, and mental calm. “It’s almost like a mental therapy for me. When I go into water and dive, it’s almost like a cleansing ritual. Usually I drive home with a big stupid grin on my face. It doesn’t matter how bad the morning was, how much I was worried about work, life, responsibilities, kids and all other things.”\nJanine working on a conservation project involving fresh water turtles in Florida\nJanine:   Janine shared her perspective with us on how time has allowed women in her age group to focus on activities that they might not have been able to participate in when they were younger. “ When I was in junior high and high school, you could play girl ’ s volleyball and girl ’ s softball, but you couldn’t run cross-country. That was too hard for girls to do and they might hurt themselves. We had to take home economics classes. We had to learn how to sew. We had to learn how to bake a cake. We had to learn and that was required.” Janine expressed that the mindfulness and meditation aspects of freediving have enormously benefitted her and the people she works with through her company, Deep Awareness Diving . She became an instructor not only to help older adults to get into freediving, but because she believes that freediving can help women who are survivors of trauma.\nAlasdair:   Alasdair shared with us that getting into freediving at a later age has both advantages and disadvantages. While it may be harder to break bad habits, he shared that adapting to change and a curiosity for lifelong learning are useful traits to cultivate. “ As a leader in our local community, I really didn’t get much feedback, and nor did I quite honestly look for it. I think my freediving would have improved a lot more if I was more open to coaching or advice from other people, so now I listen very carefully. I like to listen at the edge of the conversation and then I’ll take away the tip and try and synthesize the correct solution for me.” Alasdair then discussed how beginning one’s freediving journey later in life allows for a better sense of strengths and weaknesses, as well as a better understanding of one’s emotions. “I don’t see age as being a problem. Honestly. You play your cards that you have, so you take advantage of your strong points.”\nJennifer Brant and Janine Cianciolo get ready to compete for the CMAS Freediving Depth World Championships in Honduras.\nJennifer: When asked about age in relation to competitive freediving, Jennifer pointed out that many of the top divers in women’s freediving started in their late forties and early fifties, and she’s looking forward to the growth of competitive freediving for athletes in the Masters division. “It’s something we’re meant to do, something we can do at any age. As your comfort increases, your performance increases.” While Jennifer admits that some freediving disciplines may become more difficult with age, she asserts that many of the age-related challenges in freediving can be overcome by starting earlier and maintaining flexibility as we get older.\nFreediving and Life Satisfaction\nWhile we didn’t get to include all of the amazing insights provided by each of our four knowledgeable freedivers, we did find common themes in the advice they would give to someone who is interested in freediving but might be hesitant due to age. Their advice was to just go for it, to not get caught up on numbers and progression, and to focus on your personal experience. Each of them discussed the support that they’ve found in the freediving community for people looking to get started or progress in their skills. Alasdair had a poignant final insight to share with us in closing. “In a way, freediving reflects life because it’s all about the journey and your own satisfaction with that journey. When you’ve done your dive, you want to look back on your dive and go, wow, that was a great dive. I’m really pleased with that. Just as you do with your life.”\nAvi, Jen, Alasdair, and Janine are all competing in the Masters division at the CMAS World Championships as part of the US National Team.
