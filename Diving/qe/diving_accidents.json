On June 16, 2015 a diving accident occurred in Dutch Spring, Pennsylvania. A 41 year old scuba diver was found in the water unresponsive at the Dutch Springs Recreational Area.\nThe cause of death has not been released, however, that did not stop the local newspapers from claiming the area is dangerous and making calls for an investigation of the business.\nThe recreational area is a converted quarry with a 50 acres (20 hectare) land area and an equal sized water area. The quarry has sloped sides with an assortment of underwater attractions and has a maximum depth of 100 feet.\nMost of the items placed as underwater attractions which includes trucks, buses and an airplane are around 50 feet deep. The park is one of the most popular diving locations on the east coast and is frequently used for training. There were an estimated 70,000 dives done last year at the park. The park has had 16 deaths in the last 30 years.\nFollow these rules to prevent a scuba diving disaster\nThe opening line of the newspaper article – “In the thrill-seeking world of scuba diving” – alerted me that the article would be negative about dive safety.\nLater in the article was a statement – “a recreational diver from Bethlehem, said Dutch Springs should post signs indicating the number of fatalities it has had as a way to drive home warnings about the dangers” – that further showed the journalist knows nothing about diving.\nQuarries seem to have a higher numbers of accidents, but the high concentration of dives is a reasonable explanation. I cannot image 70,000 dives a year on my favorite reef.\nScuba diving is a prime example of proper risk management.\nDiving is an inherently dangerous sport and yes, diving Accidents do happen. However, advancement in equipment design and proper training has brought the risk to a level that recreational scuba diving is no longer considered an extreme sport but a family sport.\nWhen you make comparisons between sports using serious injuries and death as the measurement, Scuba diving falls slightly below horseback riding and golf and just above that ultra-dangerous sport, table tennis.\nWhy do Diving Accidents Happen?\nDue to the environment and the lingering believe it is dangerous, scuba diving accidents are investigated and reported more deeply than other sports. Organizations like the Diver Alert Network (DAN) and the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC), maintain records and statistics of diving accidents with the goal of avoiding future incidents. Both of these organizations provide annual reports on their websites.\nWhile the BSAC report covers a smaller group, BSAC divers and dives within UK waters, it provides a broader look at diving incidents including dive related surface events. I highly recommend all divers review the reports.\nAs you read these reports and other items that talk about diving accidents especially fatal ones, clear patterns emerge. Panic plays an important role in the majority of the accidents and very often divers going beyond their limits is the trigger.\nDive Safe and Avoid Diving Accidents from Happening\nRapid Ascents Cause Diving Accidents\nIn accident investigation and management, the term trigger is often used. The event trigger is the first thing that occurred in the chain of events that lead to the actual accident. It may have been a seemly minor item, such as a leaking mask , however, it led to the next step and onward until all control was lost. In reality, you can say a definition of an accident is the total loss of control of an event.\nA rapid ascent is the largest cause of injury and death in scuba diving. DCI (decompression illness) and air embolisms are the largest two groups of injuries. Rapid ascent is the main factor in DCI when a cause is known. In an estimated 36% of all the incidents, the rapid ascent was the result of a panic reaction.\nA reported death illustrates the power of panic.\nA father and son were diving a wreck with the son being a newly trained diver. The father diving around 90 feet was slightly above the son and was watching him. Unfortunately, he was not paying attention to his gauges, and he was diving into a current.\nThe father ran out of air, but instead of clear thinking and relying on training, the father bolted to the surface. As the father ascended, the expansion of air in the tank gave him a few extra breaths. Around the 30 foot depth, the father seemed to recover from his panic and realized he had added a pony bottle to his equipment.\nIn his panic, not only did he forget about his dive buddy’s octopus, but he also forgot his alternate supply. The son joined him, and together they made it back to the surface. However, prior to boarding the boat the father lost consciousness and died. The cause of death was an air embolism.\nIn this case a trigger of failing to monitor his gauges lead to running out of air that created a panic reaction that lead to a rapid ascent and death. The diver had two options that would have resulted in no injuries if he had not panicked.\nAlso read: Why You Should Never Miss A Safety Stop\nPoor buoyancy control can lead to death\nPoor buoyancy control is the second leading cause of rapid ascents accounting for 27% of the accidents. As a diver ascends the air in his jacket expands and increases the rate of ascent. Many divers that start a minor uncontrolled ascent fail to take actions before the momentum make it more difficult to do so.\nTheir body position also may make it difficult to vent all the air from the BCD. Flaring your body to increase drag while dumping air can assist you in regaining control. These are skills learned in OWD training but often forgotten and seldom practiced.\nIf the situation were caused by the diver being underweight, they should have recognized the problem occurring as the cylinder started becoming more negatively buoyant. Aborting the dive early, notifying the dive buddy of the problem and returning to an anchor line if there is one can help control the situation, so it does not become an emergency.\nLearn how to deploy your Surface Marker Buoy\nThe third major reason in this group surprisingly deals with the incorrect deployment of a DSMB. 26% of the incidents involve the deployment of a Delayed Surface Marker Buoy (DSMB). While not a skill that is taught in detail, it is a task that is becoming more common.\nIf You are not well trained or are careless, it is easy to become entangled in the line and pulled to the surface.  Practice deploying a DSMB at a depth that the device cannot pull you to the surface.\nAlso read: 6 Valuable Tips To Help You Improve Your Buoyancy Control\nKnow Your Limits\nWhen we take our open water training, we are taught how to react to a variety of situations. It is a good foundation to grow our diving skills and become more comfortable and confident underwater. It does not make us experts, though, by repeated diving and slowly challenging ourselves we become better divers.\nHowever, open water divers are limited to 66 feet/20 meters varying slightly between agencies. The reason is that once we descend past this mark the additional risks become more important to understand.\nNitrogen narcosis is a mere mention in OWD training, but a very important risk to understand and recognize as you approach the 30-meter mark. Exceeding your bottom is not likely to happen in less than 60 feet. Most divers will run out of air first.\nAn Australian study a few years ago showed hookah divers a.k.a SNUBA with a DCI rate ten times greater than scuba divers. No one told them the dangers of staying down and the surface supply air came as long as the pump was running. Advance open water training is a must if you want to go deeper than OWD depths.\nMany accidents can be traced back to a diver being in conditions they were not able to handle. Often they were in situations they were not trained for like; Deep diving, penetration of wrecks , and advance conditions such as low visibility and currents.\nMany recreational divers do not know that diving in a dry suit requires skills not taught in other courses and are not something you just go out and try. Finding themselves in situations beyond their understanding and ability to respond to is another trigger that can lead to a panic response. There is no clear answer what causes diving accidents because it involves so many factors.\nPanic is clearly a major component. Training, muscle memory and clear understanding of your diving environment can help us overcome a panic reaction. The more frequently we dive using good practices, the better we become at our responses and avoiding panic.\nKey take aways to prevent a diving accident from happening\nAlways dive well within your personal limits\nPractices makes perfect! Practice your buoyancy skills\nPractice how to deploy a DSMB safely before you do so in open water\nKeep an eye on your gauges and your buddy\nDo a buddy check before you get in the water\nDo not enter caves or wrecks when you are not properly trained to do so\nUse common sense at all times\nIf you have not dived for a while take a refresher to practice the basic skill for safe diving before you take the plunge.\nWhat are your thoughts about how to prevent diving accidents?

This represents a rate of approximately 3.4 to 4.2 deaths per 100,000 divers according to the scuba diver organization DAN America. While the causes of these commercial scuba diving deaths vary, most occur due to multiple root causes, including gas-supply problems (41%), entrapment/entanglement (19%), and equipment troubles (16%). Countless more divers sustain serious injuries that can lead to permanent disabilities. Other common causes of scuba diving accidents include: emergency ascent, insufficient breathing gas, and buoyancy problems. In the Puget Sound area, commercial diving includes harvesting of commercial seafood, diving to support construction operations on piers and docks, diving to support repair of vessels, and other commercial underwater activities. Many of these accidents could be prevented by employers followed the safety regulations set forth in Chapter 296-37 of the Washington Administrative Code. The WAC provides specific rules to limit the risk of injuries and deaths to commercial divers. Planning for a diving operation must include a safety and health assessment of the diver under WAC 296-37-535(4). Diving operations must be coordinated with other activities in the area that might interfere with diver safety under WAC 296-37-535(5).\nCoverage for Commercial Divers Under the Jones Act\nMany commercial divers have coverage for injuries or deaths under the federal Jones Act and general maritime law. Under the Jones Act, a diver can be considered a seaman entitled to Jones Act coverage for injuries and deaths if the commercial diver: (1) works on a vessel “in navigation”; (2) has an employment connection to the vessel that is substantial both in terms of duration and its nature; and (3) the diver’s work contributes to the work of the vessel. See, e.g., Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U.S. 347, 1995 AMC 1840 (1995). The question of whether a commercial diver is considered a “seaman” under the Jones Act can be complex and requires a detailed fact-analysis by an experienced commercial diving maritime lawyer looking at the specific nature of the diver’s work and its relationship to the vessel. If you have questions about whether you or your loved one is entitled to coverage under the Jones Act, our lawyers offer a free consultation to help you determine your rights under the Jones Act.\nBenefits Under the Jones Act\nFollowing an injury or death to a commercial diver who is covered under the Jones Act, the commercial diver is entitled to a number of benefits. For injuries, the injured diver is entitled to maintenance, cure, and unearned wages. Maintenance is a daily stipend to cover the injured commercial diver’s room-and-board expenses while they recover from an injury. Medical cure is the medial expenses related to an injury. Unearned wages are wages that the injured commercial diver would have earned through the end of the voyage or pay-period. Further, if the diver’s injury was caused by the negligence of the diver’s employer, negligence of a co-worker, unsafe condition, or malfunctioning equipment, the diver can recover damages for lost wages, lost earning capacity, retraining costs, pain, disability, suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life. If you have questions about your rights to damages following a commercial diving accident, contact our law firm for a free consultation with an experienced maritime injury attorney.\nIn the context of a commercial diving death, the Jones Act allow for recovery of pre-death pain and suffering and pecuniary losses, including the loss of care and nurture to surviving children, financial support and contributions that the deceased would have made to survivors, loss of services, loss of inheritance, and funeral expenses. A Jones Act wrongful death claim must be brought by a personal representative for the benefit of (1) the surviving spouse or children; (2) parents; and (3) dependent next of kin.

Here is the truth about dive accident insurance and what you should know before getting in the water.\nCompare Coverage\nI’m a Safe, Experienced Diver Who Won’t Get Hurt\nThink technical divers and new divers are the most at-risk for an accident? Think again. According to DAN’s Annual Diving Report , a majority of incidents occurred at depths shallower than 35 feet / 10 meters. Additionally, the highest number of fatalities occurred among divers certified for 16-20 years.\nI Don’t Dive Often Enough to Need Dive Accident Insurance\nVacation divers are just as susceptible to accidents as those who dive every weekend. Also, certain dive accident insurance plans include coverage for other in-water activities such as boating, kayaking, paddle-boarding, surfing, waterskiing and wakeboarding.\nMy Medical Insurance Already Covers Diving Accidents\nSome insurance companies provide coverage for scuba diving injuries but many do not. Here are six important questions every diver should ask their insurance provider.\nAm I covered for local /domestic diving? Some insurance policies only activate if the insured is more than 50 miles away from home or travelling internationally. DAN dive accident insurance plans provide coverage when diving accidents happen locally and when traveling.\nDoes my coverage include emergency transportation? An air ambulance can be the most expensive part of a diving accident. Some insurance plans may cover the cost of hyperbaric treatments and not the cost of getting you to the chamber.\nAre there depth limits? Ask if you have coverage for dives (planned or accidentally) deeper than 130 feet / 40 meters.\nAre tests, medications, and follow-up care covered? Treatment for serious dive accidents can include inpatient rehab and months of physical therapy.\nDoes my policy cover the cost of unexpected travel expenses? It’s not unusual for an injured diver to spend a week or more abroad while recovering from a diving accident. The additional cost of lodging and re-booking airfare can quickly climb into the thousands.\nIs return travel for a companion and/or children included? DAN Membership includes insurance that provides a way for your traveling companion (and/or children) to return home due to a covered medical emergency. If a DAN Member is traveling alone with their children, a qualified travel escort will be provided at no charge if necessary. Additionally, if you’re traveling alone and must be hospitalized for more than seven consecutive days, DAN TravelAssist will arrange and pay for economy round-trip airfare for a visitor to travel to the site of hospitalization.\nFor residents of NY, insurance is underwritten by The United States Life Insurance Company in the City of New York, NAIC No. 70106 domiciled in the state of New York, with its principal place of business of 28 Liberty Street, Floor 45th, New York, NY 10005-1400.

[1]\nAn investigation of some kind usually follows a fatal diving accident, or one in which litigation is expected. There may be several investigations with different agendas. If police are involved, they generally look for evidence of a crime. In the U.S., the United States Coast Guard will usually investigate if there is a death when diving from a vessel in coastal waters. Health and safety administration officials may investigate when the diver was injured or killed at work. When a death occurs during an organised recreational activity, the certification agency's insurers will usually send an investigator to look into possible liability issues. The investigation may occur almost immediately to some considerable time after the event. In most cases the body will have been recovered and resuscitation attempted, and in this process equipment is usually removed and may be damaged or lost, or the evidence compromised by handling. Witnesses may have dispersed, and equipment is often mishandled by the investigating authorities if they are unfamiliar with the equipment and store it improperly, which can destroy evidence and compromise findings. [2]\nRecreational diving accidents are usually relatively uncomplicated, but accidents involving an extended range environment or specialised equipment may require expertise beyond the experience of any one investigator. [2] This is a particular issue when rebreather equipment is involved. [3] Investigators who are not familiar with complex equipment may not know enough about the equipment to understand that they do not know enough.\nFor every incident in which someone is injured of killed, it has been estimated that a relatively large number of \"near miss\" incidents occur, which the diver manages well enough to avoid harm. Ideally these will be recorded, analysed for cause, reported, and the results made public, so that similar incidents can be avoided in the future.

The purpose is generally to allow avoidance of recurrences of the circumstances leading to the incident if practicable, and where relevant, to establish whether there was fault attributable to any involved party, which could lead to criminal or civil charges. [1] : Ch1 \nAccident investigation may help to identify the cause of a specific accident. If a pattern can be identified this may inform procedures and legislation to reduce the risk of the same pattern of accident recurring in the future. An investigation may identify shortcomings in training or procedures, or problems with equipment. Fatalities are often investigated as potential crimes until the cause of death has been identified. Insurance claims may rely on information from an investigation to establish whether the accident is covered by a policy. Occupational health and safety inspectors may investigate an occupational diving incident to identify whether regulations have been violated. Civil litigation for claimed damages can be more equitably decided when the circumstances leading to the injury have been identified. The ability to provide documentary evidence showing that correct procedure was followed can simplify the investigation and may lead to more accurate and reliable findings. [1] : Ch1 \nEquipment, procedures, organization, environment, individual factors and interactions between them are the sources of contributing and compounding events and conditions. Analysis of near accidents can be of great value to identify sources of error and allow planning to reduce or eliminate contributing and compounding conditions. A safety study estimated about a million shortcuts taken per fatal accident. [5]\nAccident investigations typically focus on the end event, and attempt to erect barriers to similar accidents, such as personal protection equipment, backup equipment or alarm systems. These are intended to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents, and are often effective in this limited goal. Accidents continue to occur because the majority of the contributing and compounding factors are not addressed. Human behavior and the systems in which people work are too complex to analyse all possible interactions. [6] A more effective route to accident prevention is to reduce or mitigate the occurrence of human error by focusing on the contributing and compounding human factors that create an environment in which accidents are likely to occur. [7]\nGeneral procedures\nedit\nThe victims of diving accidents are generally recovered or rescued by other divers in the vicinity. It is unusual for a diver to be left underwater with no immediate attempt at recovery, so in situ forensic investigation is seldom applicable, and the investigation usually relies on the accounts of witnesses. Different people may make different reports and develop different opinions about what happened. It is not unusual for people with less knowledge and understanding to misinterpret what they have seen and investigators need to gather as much information as reasonably possible to improve the chance of getting accurate information. [1] : Ch8 \nRecommended autopsy procedures have been summarised by specialists in diving fatality investigations and are available as guidelines to reduce the risk of overlooking pertinant evidence by pathologists less experienced in diving related autopsies. [8]\nThere are three parts to a fatal accident investigation. [3]\nAutopsy to determine where possible any medical factors that may have caused or contributed towards the death, [3]\nInvestigation of the sequence of events to determine whether any procedural or behavioural issues caused or contributed towards the death. This is usually done through witness interviews and looking into the deceased's history of training and experience, and [3]\nInspection and testing of the equipment used by the deceased, to find out if any equipment problems, defects, or malfunctions were contributory. [3]\nMost marine incident emergency response and accident investigation protocols have been written to manage surface incidents. These protocols are often inadequate for discovering the facts that could improve diving safety, and there is often a lack of cooperation between investigators and stakeholders in the outcomes of investigations. [3]\nIt is not usually necessary to dive to inspect the site of a diving accident, but sometimes there are unusual environmental features which make underwater inspection desirable. [1] : Ch9 \nRecreational diving accidents\nedit\nA large proportion of recreational divers use a personal decompression computer to monitor depth, time and decompression status. These generally log a dive profile by recording depth and time at regular intervals, and this data can usually be downloaded or inspected on the instrument. This usually constitutes a reliable and objective record of the actual dive profile, and is normally admissible as evidence. Accuracy may vary depending on calibration. In some cases assistance from the factory may be needed to recover the data. [9] [10] [11] Similar, often more detailed information may be recorded by the electronic control system of a rebreather. [12]\nThis section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( December 2018 )\nto be expanded [1] : Ch11 \nProfessional diving accidents\nedit\nThere will generally be regulatory requirements regarding both the performance and record keeping for a professional dive, and these may vary in detail depending on the jurisdiction. Where diving falls under occupational health and safety legislation any accident occurring at work may be investigated by the responsible OHS organisation, and if criminal activity is suspected, also by the police. The regulations will probably require a documentary record of the risk assessment associated with the dive, a documented dive plan for the specific dive, an operations manual specifying the accepted equipment and procedures, checklists for preparation and pre-dive checks, and a record of the timeline and depths of the diving operation in the diving operations log. All of these may be considered legal documents and evidence, but there is no guarantee that they will have been followed, and this should be checked by looking for corroborative evidence. In some jurisdictions, some forms of professional diving may be covered by different regulations, exemptions or conditional exemptions. [1] : Ch13 \nProfessional diving on scuba also frequently uses dive computers as dive profile recorders. The data logged by the computer can be useful in determining the details of the dive profile and interpreting the sequence of events, particularly where there is no communications recording available. [11] Similar, often more detailed information may be recorded by the electronic control system of a rebreather. [12]\nThis section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( December 2018 )\nto be expanded [1] : Ch12 \nCommercial diving accidents\nedit\nSurface supplied diving usually uses a diver intercom system to provide voice communications between the diver and supervisor, both for management and control of the dive, and for safety, as the supervisor can monitor the condition of the diver by hearing the breathing sounds. It is standard procedure for many (possibly most) contractors to record the voice communications of the dive and retain them for at least 24 hours, or longer in the case of an incident. These recordings are usually available as evidence in an official investigation. Surface supplied divers do not generally carry personal decompression computers, as depth profile is monitored from the surface, and decompression is controlled by the supervisor, who will log changes in depth as and when they occur. [1] : Ch13 \nPreservation and disclosure of evidence\nedit\nFailure to identify, preserve, and produce critical evidence such as dive computer data can result in sanctions against the responsible party, including findings in favour of the party requesting the lost information. Investigators without a sufficient knowledge of diving equipment have been known to destroy or lose critical evidence through mishandling of equipment, even when it survived rescue and recovery efforts. [13]\nIn US Federal law the owner of equipment that logs data during an incident that may be the subject of litigation is obliged to preserve that data and make it available as evidence if the case comes to court at a later date. Litigants are required to find out what they have and disclose everything relevant to the opposition. [11]\nDetailed checklists and standardised report formats have been developed for use by investigators to minimise the risk of missing important evidence and of compromising the evidence. These are available for open-circuit and rebreather equipment. [14] [15] [16]\nSpecial procedures for rebreather equipment\nedit\nAlthough all cases where a diver dies while wearing a rebreather are classified as rebreather fatalities, this does not necessarily mean that a rebreather equipment problem was a contributory factor to the death of the diver. Not much is known about the root causes of these accidents because many investigations were inadequate and such findings as exist are often not made public. This makes it difficult to objectively improve the equipment, procedures and training so that the faults and errors are not repeated. [3]\nThe most common equipment tests in rebreather incidents include examination of the equipment, scrubber testing, oxygen consumption tests, work of breathing measurements, checks on electronics and sensors, and tests of modifications where present. Equipment problems are the trigger for a large percentage of incidents, though equipment failures are less common. Procedural and human-machine interactions are a significant factor in rebreather incidents, and more common than in open circuit diving. [17]\nIn the European Union, breathing apparatus for underwater use is a category III product, meaning that failures are potentially lethal. The harmonised standard for diving rebreathers is EN 14143-2003, so rebreathers will be checked against that standard. [17]\nThe appropriate tests depend on the condition of the unit and the specifics of the case. As a general rule the first items are to download the logs from dive computers and breathing apparatus following the manufacturer's specifications. The assembled rebreather's exterior is checked and photographed, and the gas content of the counterlung is sampled and analyzed. Although there are many possibilities for the counterlung gas to mix with the surroundings, a finding of a low oxygen content may indicate hypoxia if there is no evidence of an alternative cause of low oxygen levels. The content of the cylinders is also measured and analysed and the cylinders, regulator and check valves inspected. The work of breathing is measured on the appropriate equipment. [17]\nThe unit is dismantled and the sensors, electronics and battery are tested, and the scrubber inspected. After cleaning, disinfecting and reassembly, the unit is test dived, in case there is some subtle problem that can be detected by an expert user, such as buoyancy, weight distribution and performance in various orientations. Ergonomics and performance implications of any customisation will be checked. All results are recorded, and photographs taken at various stages of the procedures. [17]\nCauses of diving accidents\nedit\nCauses of diving accidents are the triggering events that when combined with inadequate response, lead to an adverse consequence which may be classified as a notifiable incident or an accident when injury or death follows. These causes can be categorised as human factors, equipment problems and environmental factors. Equipment problems and environmental factors are also often influenced by human error. [18]\nThe risk of injury varies with the mode and classification of the dive. In recreational diving it is generally possible for a diver to make several errors of judgement or calculation without adverse effects. More technical dive profiles may be less tolerant of error to the extent that a single error may be life-threatening, so technical divers tend to carry and use equipment to mitigate such possible errors, and to use and practice procedures known to reduce the risk of committing such errors. [10] Professional diving is generally required to have a risk as low as reasonably practicable, and this implies the use of equipment redundancy , procedures known to minimise risk, and the availability of support personnel and equipment on site to mitigate reasonably foreseeable incidents. [19]\nHuman factors\nedit\nSee also: Human factors in diving safety\nHuman error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time. The consequences of these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause significant harm, but others can have catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. [6] Inexperience and lack of competence are the commonest root causes of diving fatalities. Inattention and negligence are known to be common contributory factors in diving accidents, and have been the root cause of some accidents. [18]\nPhysiological factors\nedit\nA wide range of physiological factors may trigger or contribute towards a diving accident. The causes of death or serious injury in diving accidents include drowning, lung overpressure accidents, decompression sickness, carbon monoxide poisoning and trauma due to impact with boats. These are usually the final effect and may be combined, though the usually the cause of death is attributed to just one of the causes. Acute oxygen toxicity, hypoxia, hypothermia and squeezes (barotrauma) may also be primary causes of diving accidents. [1] : Ch4 \nPhysiological triggering events that may lead to a diving accident, but are not generally the direct cause of death include nitrogen narcosis, dehydration, exhaustion, hypothermia, excessive work of breathing, motion sickness and the effects of alcohol and recreational drugs. Occasionally side effects of medical pharmaceuticals may also trigger an accident. Epileptic seizures should not occur, as a history of epilepsy is a bar to diver training, but cases have occurred where the problem was not disclosed and the person subsequently died as a result of drowning after losing their air supply during a seizure. These factors are often overlooked in accident investigations, and this may lead to a misleading conclusion about the cause of death. [1] : Ch4 \nProblems not directly related to diving may also cause death while diving, such as a cardiac event or stroke, possibly triggered by the physical effort of a difficult situation. These causes may be overlooked and the death inaccurately ascribed to drowning. [1] : Ch4 \nDrowning may be the most common reported cause of death in diving incidents. However, an autopsy listing drowning as the cause of death may not have established the reason for drowning, and autopsies on diving accident victims require a specific set of procedures to detect evidence of other possible causes. Drowning has been reported as the default finding in water related deaths where other causes were not detected, and may be erroneous. A properly equipped diver following recommended practices, diving in an environment compatible with their competence and in good health should not drown. When drowning is the direct cause of death it has usually been the final stage of a cascade of incidents which at some stage got out of the diver's control and culminated in drowning. The sequence of events is relatively difficult to establish and requires an understanding and familiarity with the equipment and procedures which may not be known to the investigators. This lack of clarity can lead to inappropriate litigation. [1] : Ch4 \nPsychological factors\nedit\nIn a high risk environment, as is the case in diving, human error is more likely to have catastrophic consequences. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career. [20] These findings were independently corroborated by a survey [21] that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgment or performance, and may result in an accident. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of dive accidents and fatalities. [20] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]\nProcedural factors\nedit\nOnly 4.46% of the recreational diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable to a single contributory cause. [27] The remaining fatalities probably arose as a result of a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress. [28]\nEquipment issues\nedit\nMost diving equipment is quite rugged and very reliable when correctly maintained and tested before use, but almost anything can fail and cause a problem for the diver. Some failures are merely an inconvenience, but others can be immediately life-threatening, so part of diver training is how to manage those failures which constitute an immediate risk to health or life. These are generally failures affecting breathing gas supply and buoyancy. Failures of environmental protection are generally not immediately life-threatening to recreational divers, who are able to abort a dive and surface at any time, but are more serious for divers with decompression obligations, or are unable to surface because of a physical overhead barrier, or dive in extremely cold or polluted water. Loss of buoyancy is less of a problem to surface supplied divers as they have a lifeline and do not easily run out of gas, but an uncontrolled ascent can be dangerous even when there is technically no decompression obligation. For a scuba diver, loss of breathing gas and buoyancy together can be deadly. [1] : ch3 \nOut of gas incidents\nedit\nA high proportion of scuba accidents involve running out of breathing gas. However, in the majority of these cases there is no equipment failure, or a minor equipment failure is mismanaged. Out of gas incidents are immediately life-threatening underwater, and all divers are trained in mitigation procedures. Recreational divers who rely on a dive buddy to supply gas in an emergency are expected to carry a secondary demand valve and remain close enough to their buddy to provide gas without delay in an emergency. Alternatives to gas sharing are to make an emergency ascent to the surface, a procedure implicated in a large proportion of fatalities, [29] or to carry an independent alternative gas supply. Solo and rebreather divers follow this latter strategy, and technical divers may choose to carry bailout gas or use a scuba configuration that reduces the risk of a complete loss of gas in the event of most scenarios, at the cost of greater skill requirements and task loading. Professional scuba divers may be required to carry bailout gas.\nThe submersible pressure gauge is extremely reliable, and seldom fails catastrophically without warning, though they can be inaccurate at low pressures. Occasionally a hose bursts due to immediate or accumulated damage, and a low pressure hose burst can empty a cylinder in a few minutes to seconds depending on the contents of the cylinder, while also making the remaining gas unavailable to the diver. Unrecoverable free-flows are rare, but occasionally occur, and regulator freeze can cause a free-flow which can only be stopped by closing the cylinder valve. More commonly, a diver will use up all the gas without noticing until the pressure is critically low. A common complication of loss of breathing gas supply is that the same gas supply is routinely used for breathing and buoyancy control in recreational scuba diving.\nSurface supplied divers are generally obliged to carry sufficient bailout gas to return to a place of safety if the main gas supply fails, and this is usually activated by opening a valve on the helmet or harness that is in easy reach of both hands. Unsurprisingly, the number of out of gas fatalities in surface supplied diving is very low. [19]\nBreathing gas quality problems\nedit\nContamination of the breathing gas will have effects that depend on the concentration, the ambient pressure, and the specific contaminants present. Carbon monoxide produced by overheating of the compressor, or by contamination of the intake air by internal combustion engine exhaust gas is a well known risk, and can be mitigated by using hopcalite catalyst in the high pressure filter. [30] [31] Contamination by carbon dioxide is unusual in open circuit breathing apparatus, as natural air usually has a low enough content not to be a problem at the ambient pressures of most dives. It is a relatively common problem for rebreathers, as the metabolically produced carbon dioxide in the exhaled gas must be removed chemically by the scrubber before the gas can be breathed again. Scrubber breakthrough can occur for a variety of reasons, most of them connected to user error, but some more likely due to design details of the specific unit. A slow buildup of carbon dioxide can usually be noticed by the diver in time to bail out, but sometimes the concentration can rise so rapidly that the diver is incapacitated before being able to bail out. [ citation needed ]\nUse of breathing gases other than those planned for the current depth range of a dive can have undesirable consequences. The oxygen concentration of a gas may be toxic or insufficient to support consciousness if used at an inappropriate depth, and the inert gas components will not be correctly accounted for in decompression calculations, which might result in decompression sickness. [32] Both oxygen toxicity and hypoxia may render the diver unconscious without warning, and decompression sickness symptoms may be debilitating if severe, and are generally unexpected. [ citation needed ]\nBreathing apparatus malfunctions\nedit\nSee also: Diving regulator § Malfunctions and failure modes , and Rebreather diving § Failure modes\nOpen circuit scuba is generally very reliable if correctly maintained and serviced, and tested before the dive. Maintenance and testing procedures are simple and few in number, nevertheless divers may neglect them due to complacency, distraction or incompetence. [ citation needed ]\nRebreather scuba is considerably more complex than open circuit scuba, and the number of failure modes is much greater. The complexity of routine maintenance, pre-dive setup and pre-dive testing are such that documentary checklists specific to the equipment model are strongly recommended by experts. [33] [34] Electronically mediated predive check sequences are available on some electronic closed circuit rebreathers, but even these occasionally fail to detect a latent problem. [35]\nSurface supplied diving equipment may provide a constant flow or demand regulated gas supply. The surface gas control panel allows alternative gas supplies to be connected if the primary supply fails, and a further backup supply is generally carried by the diver. This multiple redundancy reduces the number of ways the gas supply to the diver can be critically compromised, and further mitigation is provided by the standby diver, who can also supply emergency breathing gas. As a consequence, surface-supplied divers are very seldom critically affected by breathing gas supply failure. [19]\nBuoyancy problems\nedit\nSee also: Buoyancy compensator (diving) § Hazards\nInsufficient buoyancy is a problem for divers who must ascend through the water column without assistance from a lifting platform, a surface tender, or something they can climb. This effectively limits the problem to freedivers and untethered scuba divers. Insufficient buoyancy at the end of a dive can prevent the diver from surfacing before breathing gas runs out, cause the diver to sink to an unintended depth or cause a diver at the surface to be unable to stay afloat. Insufficient buoyancy at the end of a dive is usually due to diver error in carrying too much weight or to a major failure of the dry suit or buoyancy compensator (BC or BCD). Insufficient buoyancy at the start of a dive can also be caused by carrying too much weight, but can also be due to a poor match between mass of gas carried and volume of buoyancy compensator, which is usually only a problem with technical divers, who may start a dive with a relatively large mass of gas. A major flood of the dry suit can cause a sudden large loss of buoyancy at any time during a dive. A properly trained and equipped diver will be able to correct this either by BC inflation or weight shedding. Divers are trained to manage problems of insufficient buoyancy due to equipment malfunctions, and to adjust their weighting to suit the equipment used for a specific dive. The consequence of uncompensated insufficient buoyancy is usually drowning. Almost all fatalities due to insufficient buoyancy can be ascribed to diver error if the diver was conscious and able to act at the time that the problem was noticed. [18]\nExcessive buoyancy can be a problem for any diver who is constrained from making a direct uncontrolled ascent. It is a hazard for all divers who breath underwater at ambient pressure, as a rapid ascent can cause decompression illness . Excessive buoyancy at the start of a dive is usually caused by insufficient weighting, which is diver error. Loss of ballast weights can occur at any time during a dive, and can have various causes, depending on how the weights are carried, including voluntary shedding of too much weight in a perceived emergency. A third cause of excessive buoyancy, which develops during a dive and usually manifests at the end, during the ascent, is insufficient weighting to compensate for the mass of gas used during the dive. This can be almost always be ascribed to diver error, and usually occurs when a diver miscalculates the buoyancy increase due to gas usage, and does not carry sufficient weight to compensate. It is a common problem when unfamiliar equipment is used without a checkout dive with the cylinder nearly empty. Divers will often accept the recommendations for weighting given by the dive shop supplying the equipment, or base their weighting on similar equipment used in the past. For recreational divers who do not exceed the no-stop limit, this is seldom seriously harmful. At worst the ascent rate may be a little fast near the surface and they will be unable to do a safety stop, but for divers with a significant decompression obligation, it can have more serious consequences. Surface supplied divers who plan a dive with long decompression obligations usually carry weights which cannot easily be removed, to reduce the risk of accidentally losing them and becoming uncontrollably buoyant. The other common cause of excessive buoyancy which can occur at any time in a dive, is excess gas in the dry suit or buoyancy compensator. This can be caused by several factors, some of which can be classed as diver error, and others as equipment malfunction, but divers are trained to deal with these malfunctions as they are reasonably foreseeable, so failure to correct them when they occur is also generally a diver error in the wider sense. [18]\nBuoyancy compensator malfunction has been implicated in a significant number of fatal incidents, usually due to a problem with the inflator mechanism, but in some cases the BCD could not stay inflated. In most of these fatalities, the buoyancy compensator was not used competently, usually by over-inflation which caused an uncontrolled ascent, or deflating when more buoyancy was required at the surface. [36] Overweighting can also be classified as misuse of equipment. Inability to inflate the buoyancy compensator can also occur when the diver runs out of breathing gas, as the breathing gas supply is generally the inflation gas supply. This can complicate an emergency ascent, particularly if the diver is not immediately aware of the implications relating to buoyancy of breathing gas loss.\nBCD blowups can occur when the inflation valve sticks open. In most cases this can be quickly corrected, either by pulling the valve closed or by disconnecting the LP inflation hose, and if the system has a low flow rate when fully open, this is seldom a major problem, as it is possible to dump air faster than it flows into the BCD. However, some inflator systems have a high flow rate, and if these valves stick fully open, the diver may not be able to dump fast enough to prevent being dragged upwards, at which stage a positive feedback of expansion of gas already in the BCD and possibly also the suit may become unrecoverable. Attempts to fin downwards against the buoyancy are likely to trap gas in the BCD and suit. Ascents are safer if the diver is trimmed feet down and shoulders high to facilitate dumping from both suit and BCD.\nDouble bladder BCDs are used by some technical divers as a backup in case the primary fails by not retaining air. This can happen if the inflation hose tears or comes off, or the bladder has a major puncture near the top that cannot be compensated by trim. The problem with this form of equipment redundancy occurs when the diver inadvertently inflates or deflates the wrong bladder. It is also possible for the inflation valve of a secondary bladder with low pressure inflation supply to malfunction and leak gas into the bladder without the diver's input or knowledge, and the diver then finds it impossible to dump sufficient gas from what they mistakenly believe to be the inflated bladder. This risk can be avoided by not connecting a pressure supply hose to the inflator for the secondary bladder, by having a distinctly different style of inflator mechanism, by mounting it on the other side of the diver to the primary inflator, and by never using it underwater while the primary bladder is functional. The other way of managing this problem is to mount the two inflator valve units together, and basically always assume that both bladders have gas in then, so always dump from both at the same time. This may be problematic if the diver needs to deflate while inverted and the lower dump valves are not positioned to allow simultaneous operation.\nIf a dry suit is worn, the dry suit can be inflated as a substitute for the BCD in an emergency, but a dry suit is not well suited to operate at a good trim with a large amount of gas inside, and the risk of a runaway inverted ascent is significant. Remaining upright and ascending without delay is most likely to avoid complications.\nDivers who carry a delayed surface marker buoy (DSMB) can use it to signal the surface that they are ascending, and use it to positively control depth and ascent rate once deployed, by maintaining some tension in the line. The equipment is considered an important safety aid, but deployment is a period of relatively high risk, as if the line snags and stops unrolling the buoyancy may be sufficient to drag the diver up far enough to cause the expansion of the suit and BCD to get out of control, and if the diver lets go of the DSMB it will be lost. A spare DSMB and spool may be carried in case of this contingency. The risks of deploying the DSMB with the reel clipped to the diver are considered unacceptable by some, and this practice has been implicated in fatal accidents.\nThermal problems\nedit\nHypothermia\nOverheating ( hyperthermia ) is a less common problem, and is usually associated with special environments. It can be particularly problematic as the physiological response to overheating of sweating does not work in water or a diving suit where relative humidity rapidly reaches 100% and there can be no evaporative cooling. Hyperthermia can simply be avoided by recreational divers in almost all circumstances, as water temperature is normally known before entry, but professional divers may have work in water which is too hot to operate without artificial cooling. In some cases this can be done simply by running cooling water through a hot-water suit , but the situation can be complicated when the diver must also be isolated from environmental contamination. Cooling vests and \"tube suits\" have been used for this application. [1]\nScalding in hot water suits\nThis section needs expansion with: accidents and injuries caused by thermal problems.

( May 2021 )\nHazardous tools and activities\nedit\nUnderwater cutting and welding activities involve the use of live electrical conductors exposed to the water in the close proximity of the diver using them. Electrocution is possible, though unlikely to be fatal. as the voltages are fairly low. They also involve extreme heat and the generation of explosive gases, which may accumulate under obstacles to their free escape, and may detonate, causing pressure trauma to the diver. Stringent precautions are required for using this equipment, including training in the appropriate procedures. Nevertheless, accidents occasionally happen. The equipment used and injuries manifested are pointers towards possible triggering events. [ citation needed ]\nProfessional divers are often required to assist with the lifting and placement of large, massive objects underwater during the course of their employment. This exposes them to hazards of impact, pinching and crushing. Trauma caused by such incidents is usually obvious and easily identified. In some cases the triggering incident is a lapse of procedure, other times it may be an unexpected environmental effect, though seldom unforeseeable. Occasionally a failure of properly tested, inspected and operated equipment may occur. Negligence is often contributory to such accidents. Recreational divers are usually not sufficiently trained to safely perform these tasks, and are at greater risk. Entanglement in a runaway buoyant lift is a hazard specifically of working with lift bags , and particularly when filling them with breathing gas from scuba cylinders carried by the diver. Filling a lift bag at depth can deplete the gas supply in a cylinder rapidly, so a dedicated cylinder should be used when this work must be done on scuba. [ citation needed ]\nHigh pressure water-jetting injuries are usually easy to recognise. Investigation of incidents involving such injuries is likely to include identifying procedural causes, or occasionally equipment malfunction, which may also have a procedural cause. [ citation needed ]\nExplosives are used underwater by commercial divers for demolition and to power tools to attach bolts to a structure. They may also be encountered by divers in the form of unexploded munitions of various ages and unknown stability.\nThis section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( May 2021 )\nEnvironmental factors\nedit\nSee also: List of diving hazards and precautions\nOverhead environments where a direct vertical ascent to the surface is not possible. Examples include flooded caves and mines , sewers , closed tanks , culverts , penstocks and the interior of shipwrecks .\nStrong current and surge\nPressure differentials, particularly when they cause flow towards an enclosed space or mechanical hazard. A pressure difference can draw a diver into a hazard, or trap the diver against an opening too small to pass through. In extreme cases the pressure difference across a small opening can cause direct trauma.\nEntrapment hazards\nHazardous materials\nThis section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( May 2021 )\nAutopsy findings\nedit\nFurther information: Scuba diving fatalities § Cause of death\nDrowning is death resulting from hypoxemia caused by asphyxiation by immersion in a liquid. It is very often the direct cause of death in diving accidents, but usually follows a series of events triggered by an event which need not necessarily have been fatal. Drowning is a diagnosis of exclusion, it is appropriate when other possibilities have been ruled out. In scuba diving drowning is usually the consequence of running out of breathing gas at depth or under an overhead barrier to a direct ascent to the surface, but can also occur as a consequence of loss of consciousness for any one of a variety of reasons followed by a compromised airway. In breath-hold diving, it usually occurs when the diver loses consciousness or reaches a state of hypercapnia severe enough to cause involuntary inhalation before reaching the surface. [10] The airway of a surface supplied diver is usually protected by the helmet or full-face mask, and consequently these divers should survive a loss of consciousness if rescued while a suitable breathing gas supply is available. [19]\nArterial gas embolism requires overextension and rupture of lung tissue, which in a healthy diver, can occur on ascent. A sufficient overexpansion of the lungs requires a simultaneous decrease in depth and failure to release gas from the lungs, so that the blood-air interface is ruptured while there is sufficient overpressure to force gas into pulmonary blood vessels against local blood pressure [10] It can also be caused by some lung pathologies. [ citation needed ]\nDecompression sickness requires supersaturation of tissues during the decompression of ascent, and bubble formation is affected by ascent rate and the amount of gas dissolved in the tissues during exposure to pressure while breathing. Presence of tissue bubbles during autopsy is not necessarily an indication of DCS as gas will come out of solution when a body is decompressed by recovering to the surface. Dive history as recorded by a personal dive computer or bottom timer can indicate a probability of gas bubbles being a consequence of decompression sickness, lung overpressure induced arterial gas embolism or an artifact of post mortem recovery decompression. [10]\nParadoxical gas embolism – venous blood with bubbles which would be asymptomatic if filtered through the pulmonary circulation passing through a patent foramen ovale into the systemic circulation during exertion during ascent or after surfacing, and then lodge in critical tissues where they may grow by diffusion processes. [10] Divers are often unaware of a PFO, and there is not generally a requirement to be tested for PFO for recreational or professional divers as it is not a disqualification for diving.\nCardiovascular disease: The most common natural disease process associated with diving fatalities. Often sudden death is the first indication of cardiovascular disease, but sometimes the diver had known problems but chose to continue diving. In divers older than 35 years cardiovascular disease is second only to drowning as the primary cause of death, and is frequently implicated in drownings. [10]\nCarbon monoxide poisoning is rare, but occasionally occurs due to contaminated breathing gas. Partial pressure in the breathing gas is increased in proportion to depth, and concentrations that might be tolerated at the surface could be lethal at depth. Breathing gas tests can confirm or exclude the presence of carbon monoxide in toxic concentrations. [10]\nMechanical trauma is usually obvious when it is the direct cause of death, but it is possible for less obvious injury to cause a short-term reduction in the level of consciousness sufficient for the diver to be unable to avoid drowning, or to hinder the diver from taking the necessary action.\nGeneral findings\nedit\nFurther information: Scuba diving fatalities § Manner of death\nThe direct cause of death is not usually the ultimate aim of the investigation. A finding of drowning, gas embolism or decompression sickness by the autopsy opens the question of why that happened, and whether it could or should have been avoidable. The equipment, procedures and training associated with diving are specifically intended to prevent drowning, barotrauma and decompression sickness, and a fatality caused by one of these is an indication that the system failed in some way. To be useful in preventing similar incidents, it is necessary to find out how and why the system failed. In non-fatal accidents, this is the primary purpose of the investigation. [1] [5] [7] [6]\nBuddy separation is frequently associated with recreational diving incidents. [10] This can be interpreted to indicate that the buddy system as commonly practised by recreational divers is flawed. Either the divers are not effectively adhering to the buddy system as specified by the training agencies, or the circumstances of the dive were beyond the capacity of the divers to remain together, which implies that the divers were not technically competent to perform that dive. [37] This problem is exacerbated by arbitrary pairing of strangers to dive as buddies by dive professionals who are not familiar with the competence of the divers beyond the certification they have produced when booking the dive. The dive professionals are usually indemnified by a waiver/release that the divers are required to sign as a condition of service, leaving the divers vulnerable to the consequences of being paired with an incompetent or negligent buddy, or buddies who have been trained in slightly different procedures, and may be unfamiliar with each other's equipment and intentions. [13] [37] [38] The reaction to this problem includes the two extremes – The DIR philosophy of strict adherence to a standardised system of procedures and equipment, and not diving with anyone who does not use the same system, and the self-reliant route, where the diver elects to dive as if on their own, not relying on the buddy for assistance, and carrying sufficient equipment redundancy to manage reasonably foreseeable incidents unaided. These divers may choose to dive solo rather than be burdened by a buddy of unknown competence or known incompetence, [37] but may be obstructed in this choice by legislation or terms and conditions of service. [39] [40]\nA common finding in recreational diving is human error, most often of the victim. [41] In some cases the diver was not competent for the specific activity due to lack of appropriate training, in others the scope of the training was appropriate but the diver 's skills were insufficient at the time. Even when equipment problems are involved, they are usually due to human error, either by misuse, failure to check functionality, or inappropriate reaction to a problem. [18] In professional diving, although there are considerably more safeguards required, and the incidence of accidents is lower, human error remains a major contributor, but it is sometimes error by other members of the dive team.\nCompetence of investigators\nedit\nFatal scuba diving accidents are uncommon, fatal surface-supplied diving accidents are even less common, and training of forensic investigators and pathologists does not generally include the relevant skills and specialist knowledge. Specialist workshops have been run to provide a better understanding of diving physiology and pathophysiology, epidemiology, gathering of pertinent history, familiarization with dive equipment, modification of autopsy protocol, interpretation of the findings, and determination of the most likely cause of death. [42]\nThe competence of investigators of diving accidents and incidents is usually limited to a subset of the competence to determine criminal or civil liability. This should be taken into account when presenting evidence, and investigators, expert witnesses, and the court or board of inquiry should ensure that opinions beyond the scope of their competence are specified as such so that they may be disregarded when making a judgement. [43]\nThis section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( October 2019 )\nNear miss reports\nedit\nFor every incident in which someone is injured of killed, it has been estimated that a relatively large number of \" near miss \" incidents occur, which the diver manages well enough to avoid harm. In many cases these can be ascribed to inherent hazards of diving , and the responses which compensated for the hazardous event are standard diving procedures , correctly and promptly applied, but there are also situations where something unforeseen, not immediately explicable, or previously considered highly improbable, occurs. Ideally these incidents will be recorded, analysed for cause, reported, and the results made public, so that similar incidents can be avoided in the future. [4] This tends to happen more consistently in professional diving, where occupational health and safety concerns are more closely monitored, and in organisations with an established safety culture .\nSee also\nedit\nAccident  – Unforeseen event, often with a negative outcome\nAccident analysis  – Process to determine the causes of accidents to prevent recurrence\nChain of events (accident analysis)  – Series of contributing factors leading to an undesired outcome\nCivil liability in recreational diving  – Legal duty of care, negligence and liability in recreational diving\nDiving safety  – Risk management of underwater diving activities\nFailure mode and effects analysis  – Analysis of potential system failures\nForensic science  – Application of science to criminal and civil laws\nHuman factors and ergonomics  – Designing systems to suit their users\nHuman reliability  – Factor in safety, ergonomics and system resilience\nIncident pit  – Conceptual model for explaining incident development and recovery\nOccupational safety and health  – Field concerned with the safety, health and welfare of people at work\nScuba diving fatalities  – Deaths occurring while scuba diving or as a consequence of scuba diving\nSwiss cheese model  – Model used in risk analysis\nReferences\nedit\n^ a\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\nh\ni\nj\nk\nl\nm\nn\no\np\nBarsky, Steven; Neuman, Tom (2003).

[1]\nAn investigation of some kind usually follows a fatal diving accident, or one in which litigation is expected. There may be several investigations with different agendas. If police are involved, they generally look for evidence of a crime. In the U.S., the United States Coast Guard will usually investigate if there is a death when diving from a vessel in coastal waters. Health and safety administration officials may investigate when the diver was injured or killed at work. When a death occurs during an organised recreational activity, the certification agency's insurers will usually send an investigator to look into possible liability issues. The investigation may occur almost immediately to some considerable time after the event. In most cases the body will have been recovered and resuscitation attempted, and in this process equipment is usually removed and may be damaged or lost, or the evidence compromised by handling. Witnesses may have dispersed, and equipment is often mishandled by the investigating authorities if they are unfamiliar with the equipment and store it improperly, which can destroy evidence and compromise findings. [2]\nRecreational diving accidents are usually relatively uncomplicated, but accidents involving an extended range environment or specialised equipment may require expertise beyond the experience of any one investigator. [2] This is a particular issue when rebreather equipment is involved. [3] Investigators who are not familiar with complex equipment may not know enough about the equipment to understand that they do not know enough.\nFor every incident in which someone is injured of killed, it has been estimated that a relatively large number of \"near miss\" incidents occur, which the diver manages well enough to avoid harm. Ideally these will be recorded, analysed for cause, reported, and the results made public, so that similar incidents can be avoided in the future. [4]\nReasons for investigation [ edit ]\nProfessional diving accidents are usually investigated when a reportable injury occurs in terms of occupational health and safety legislation. The purpose is generally to allow avoidance of recurrences of the circumstances leading to the incident if practicable, and where relevant, to establish whether there was fault attributable to any involved party, which could lead to criminal or civil charges. [1] : Ch1 \nAccident investigation may help to identify the cause of a specific accident. If a pattern can be identified this may inform procedures and legislation to reduce the risk of the same pattern of accident recurring in the future. An investigation may identify shortcomings in training or procedures, or problems with equipment. Fatalities are often investigated as potential crimes until the cause of death has been identified. Insurance claims may rely on information from an investigation to establish whether the accident is covered by a policy. Occupational health and safety inspectors may investigate an occupational diving incident to identify whether regulations have been violated. Civil litigation for claimed damages can be more equitably decided when the circumstances leading to the injury have been identified. The ability to provide documentary evidence showing that correct procedure was followed can simplify the investigation and may lead to more accurate and reliable findings. [1] : Ch1 \nEquipment, procedures, organization, environment, individual factors and interactions between them are the sources of contributing and compounding events and conditions. Analysis of near accidents can be of great value to identify sources of error and allow planning to reduce or eliminate contributing and compounding conditions. A safety study estimated about a million shortcuts taken per fatal accident. [5]\nAccident investigations typically focus on the end event, and attempt to erect barriers to similar accidents, such as personal protection equipment, backup equipment or alarm systems. These are intended to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents, and are often effective in this limited goal. Accidents continue to occur because the majority of the contributing and compounding factors are not addressed. Human behavior and the systems in which people work are too complex to analyse all possible interactions. [6] A more effective route to accident prevention is to reduce or mitigate the occurrence of human error by focusing on the contributing and compounding human factors that create an environment in which accidents are likely to occur. [7]\nGeneral procedures [ edit ]\nThe victims of diving accidents are generally recovered or rescued by other divers in the vicinity. It is unusual for a diver to be left underwater with no immediate attempt at recovery, so in situ forensic investigation is seldom applicable, and the investigation usually relies on the accounts of witnesses. Different people may make different reports and develop different opinions about what happened. It is not unusual for people with less knowledge and understanding to misinterpret what they have seen and investigators need to gather as much information as reasonably possible to improve the chance of getting accurate information. [1] : Ch8 \nRecommended autopsy procedures have been summarised by specialists in diving fatality investigations and are available as guidelines to reduce the risk of overlooking pertinant evidence by pathologists less experienced in diving related autopsies. [8]\nThere are three parts to a fatal accident investigation. [3]\nAutopsy to determine where possible any medical factors that may have caused or contributed towards the death, [3]\nInvestigation of the sequence of events to determine whether any procedural or behavioural issues caused or contributed towards the death. This is usually done through witness interviews and looking into the deceased's history of training and experience, and [3]\nInspection and testing of the equipment used by the deceased, to find out if any equipment problems, defects, or malfunctions were contributory. [3]\nMost marine incident emergency response and accident investigation protocols have been written to manage surface incidents. These protocols are often inadequate for discovering the facts that could improve diving safety, and there is often a lack of cooperation between investigators and stakeholders in the outcomes of investigations. [3]\nIt is not usually necessary to dive to inspect the site of a diving accident, but sometimes there are unusual environmental features which make underwater inspection desirable. [1] : Ch9 \nRecreational diving accidents [ edit ]\nA large proportion of recreational divers use a personal decompression computer to monitor depth, time and decompression status. These generally log a dive profile by recording depth and time at regular intervals, and this data can usually be downloaded or inspected on the instrument. This usually constitutes a reliable and objective record of the actual dive profile, and is normally admissible as evidence. Accuracy may vary depending on calibration. In some cases assistance from the factory may be needed to recover the data. [9] [10] [11] Similar, often more detailed information may be recorded by the electronic control system of a rebreather. [12]\nThis section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( December 2018 )\nto be expanded [1] : Ch11 \nProfessional diving accidents [ edit ]\nThere will generally be regulatory requirements regarding both the performance and record keeping for a professional dive, and these may vary in detail depending on the jurisdiction. Where diving falls under occupational health and safety legislation any accident occurring at work may be investigated by the responsible OHS organisation, and if criminal activity is suspected, also by the police. The regulations will probably require a documentary record of the risk assessment associated with the dive, a documented dive plan for the specific dive, an operations manual specifying the accepted equipment and procedures, checklists for preparation and pre-dive checks, and a record of the timeline and depths of the diving operation in the diving operations log. All of these may be considered legal documents and evidence, but there is no guarantee that they will have been followed, and this should be checked by looking for corroborative evidence. In some jurisdictions, some forms of professional diving may be covered by different regulations, exemptions or conditional exemptions. [1] : Ch13 \nProfessional diving on scuba also frequently uses dive computers as dive profile recorders. The data logged by the computer can be useful in determining the details of the dive profile and interpreting the sequence of events, particularly where there is no communications recording available. [11] Similar, often more detailed information may be recorded by the electronic control system of a rebreather. [12]\nThis section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( December 2018 )\nto be expanded [1] : Ch12 \nCommercial diving accidents [ edit ]\nSurface supplied diving usually uses a diver intercom system to provide voice communications between the diver and supervisor, both for management and control of the dive, and for safety, as the supervisor can monitor the condition of the diver by hearing the breathing sounds. It is standard procedure for many (possibly most) contractors to record the voice communications of the dive and retain them for at least 24 hours, or longer in the case of an incident. These recordings are usually available as evidence in an official investigation. Surface supplied divers do not generally carry personal decompression computers, as depth profile is monitored from the surface, and decompression is controlled by the supervisor, who will log changes in depth as and when they occur. [1] : Ch13 \nPreservation and disclosure of evidence [ edit ]\nFailure to identify, preserve, and produce critical evidence such as dive computer data can result in sanctions against the responsible party, including findings in favour of the party requesting the lost information. Investigators without a sufficient knowledge of diving equipment have been known to destroy or lose critical evidence through mishandling of equipment, even when it survived rescue and recovery efforts. [13]\nIn US Federal law the owner of equipment that logs data during an incident that may be the subject of litigation is obliged to preserve that data and make it available as evidence if the case comes to court at a later date. Litigants are required to find out what they have and disclose everything relevant to the opposition. [11]\nDetailed checklists and standardised report formats have been developed for use by investigators to minimise the risk of missing important evidence and of compromising the evidence. These are available for open-circuit and rebreather equipment. [14] [15] [16]\nSpecial procedures for rebreather equipment [ edit ]\nAlthough all cases where a diver dies while wearing a rebreather are classified as rebreather fatalities, this does not necessarily mean that a rebreather equipment problem was a contributory factor to the death of the diver. Not much is known about the root causes of these accidents because many investigations were inadequate and such findings as exist are often not made public. This makes it difficult to objectively improve the equipment, procedures and training so that the faults and errors are not repeated. [3]\nThe most common equipment tests in rebreather incidents include examination of the equipment, scrubber testing, oxygen consumption tests, work of breathing measurements, checks on electronics and sensors, and tests of modifications where present. Equipment problems are the trigger for a large percentage of incidents, though equipment failures are less common. Procedural and human-machine interactions are a significant factor in rebreather incidents, and more common than in open circuit diving. [17]\nIn the European Union, breathing apparatus for underwater use is a category III product, meaning that failures are potentially lethal. The harmonised standard for diving rebreathers is EN 14143-2003, so rebreathers will be checked against that standard. [17]\nThe appropriate tests depend on the condition of the unit and the specifics of the case. As a general rule the first items are to download the logs from dive computers and breathing apparatus following the manufacturer's specifications. The assembled rebreather's exterior is checked and photographed, and the gas content of the counterlung is sampled and analyzed. Although there are many possibilities for the counterlung gas to mix with the surroundings, a finding of a low oxygen content may indicate hypoxia if there is no evidence of an alternative cause of low oxygen levels. The content of the cylinders is also measured and analysed and the cylinders, regulator and check valves inspected. The work of breathing is measured on the appropriate equipment. [17]\nThe unit is dismantled and the sensors, electronics and battery are tested, and the scrubber inspected. After cleaning, disinfecting and reassembly, the unit is test dived, in case there is some subtle problem that can be detected by an expert user, such as buoyancy, weight distribution and performance in various orientations. Ergonomics and performance implications of any customisation will be checked. All results are recorded, and photographs taken at various stages of the procedures. [17]\nCauses of diving accidents [ edit ]\nCauses of diving accidents are the triggering events that when combined with inadequate response, lead to an adverse consequence which may be classified as a notifiable incident or an accident when injury or death follows. These causes can be categorised as human factors, equipment problems and environmental factors. Equipment problems and environmental factors are also often influenced by human error. [18]\nThe risk of injury varies with the mode and classification of the dive. In recreational diving it is generally possible for a diver to make several errors of judgement or calculation without adverse effects. More technical dive profiles may be less tolerant of error to the extent that a single error may be life-threatening, so technical divers tend to carry and use equipment to mitigate such possible errors, and to use and practice procedures known to reduce the risk of committing such errors. [10] Professional diving is generally required to have a risk as low as reasonably practicable, and this implies the use of equipment redundancy , procedures known to minimise risk, and the availability of support personnel and equipment on site to mitigate reasonably foreseeable incidents. [19]\nHuman factors [ edit ]\nSee also: Human factors in diving safety\nHuman error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time. The consequences of these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause significant harm, but others can have catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. [6] Inexperience and lack of competence are the commonest root causes of diving fatalities. Inattention and negligence are known to be common contributory factors in diving accidents, and have been the root cause of some accidents. [18]\nPhysiological factors [ edit ]\nA wide range of physiological factors may trigger or contribute towards a diving accident. The causes of death or serious injury in diving accidents include drowning, lung overpressure accidents, decompression sickness, carbon monoxide poisoning and trauma due to impact with boats. These are usually the final effect and may be combined, though the usually the cause of death is attributed to just one of the causes. Acute oxygen toxicity, hypoxia, hypothermia and squeezes (barotrauma) may also be primary causes of diving accidents. [1] : Ch4 \nPhysiological triggering events that may lead to a diving accident, but are not generally the direct cause of death include nitrogen narcosis, dehydration, exhaustion, hypothermia, excessive work of breathing, motion sickness and the effects of alcohol and recreational drugs. Occasionally side effects of medical pharmaceuticals may also trigger an accident. Epileptic seizures should not occur, as a history of epilepsy is a bar to diver training, but cases have occurred where the problem was not disclosed and the person subsequently died as a result of drowning after losing their air supply during a seizure. These factors are often overlooked in accident investigations, and this may lead to a misleading conclusion about the cause of death. [1] : Ch4 \nProblems not directly related to diving may also cause death while diving, such as a cardiac event or stroke, possibly triggered by the physical effort of a difficult situation. These causes may be overlooked and the death inaccurately ascribed to drowning. [1] : Ch4 \nDrowning may be the most common reported cause of death in diving incidents. However, an autopsy listing drowning as the cause of death may not have established the reason for drowning, and autopsies on diving accident victims require a specific set of procedures to detect evidence of other possible causes. Drowning has been reported as the default finding in water related deaths where other causes were not detected, and may be erroneous. A properly equipped diver following recommended practices, diving in an environment compatible with their competence and in good health should not drown. When drowning is the direct cause of death it has usually been the final stage of a cascade of incidents which at some stage got out of the diver's control and culminated in drowning. The sequence of events is relatively difficult to establish and requires an understanding and familiarity with the equipment and procedures which may not be known to the investigators. This lack of clarity can lead to inappropriate litigation. [1] : Ch4 \nPsychological factors [ edit ]\nIn a high risk environment, as is the case in diving, human error is more likely to have catastrophic consequences. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career. [20] These findings were independently corroborated by a survey [21] that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgment or performance, and may result in an accident. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of dive accidents and fatalities. [20] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]\nProcedural factors [ edit ]\nOnly 4.46% of the recreational diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable to a single contributory cause. [27] The remaining fatalities probably arose as a result of a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress. [28]\nEquipment issues [ edit ]\nMost diving equipment is quite rugged and very reliable when correctly maintained and tested before use, but almost anything can fail and cause a problem for the diver. Some failures are merely an inconvenience, but others can be immediately life-threatening, so part of diver training is how to manage those failures which constitute an immediate risk to health or life. These are generally failures affecting breathing gas supply and buoyancy. Failures of environmental protection are generally not immediately life-threatening to recreational divers, who are able to abort a dive and surface at any time, but are more serious for divers with decompression obligations, or are unable to surface because of a physical overhead barrier, or dive in extremely cold or polluted water. Loss of buoyancy is less of a problem to surface supplied divers as they have a lifeline and do not easily run out of gas, but an uncontrolled ascent can be dangerous even when there is technically no decompression obligation. For a scuba diver, loss of breathing gas and buoyancy together can be deadly. [1] : ch3 \nOut of gas incidents [ edit ]\nA high proportion of scuba accidents involve running out of breathing gas. However, in the majority of these cases there is no equipment failure, or a minor equipment failure is mismanaged. Out of gas incidents are immediately life-threatening underwater, and all divers are trained in mitigation procedures. Recreational divers who rely on a dive buddy to supply gas in an emergency are expected to carry a secondary demand valve and remain close enough to their buddy to provide gas without delay in an emergency. Alternatives to gas sharing are to make an emergency ascent to the surface, a procedure implicated in a large proportion of fatalities, [29] or to carry an independent alternative gas supply. Solo and rebreather divers follow this latter strategy, and technical divers may choose to carry bailout gas or use a scuba configuration that reduces the risk of a complete loss of gas in the event of most scenarios, at the cost of greater skill requirements and task loading. Professional scuba divers may be required to carry bailout gas.\nThe submersible pressure gauge is extremely reliable, and seldom fails catastrophically without warning, though they can be inaccurate at low pressures. Occasionally a hose bursts due to immediate or accumulated damage, and a low pressure hose burst can empty a cylinder in a few minutes to seconds depending on the contents of the cylinder, while also making the remaining gas unavailable to the diver. Unrecoverable free-flows are rare, but occasionally occur, and regulator freeze can cause a free-flow which can only be stopped by closing the cylinder valve. More commonly, a diver will use up all the gas without noticing until the pressure is critically low. A common complication of loss of breathing gas supply is that the same gas supply is routinely used for breathing and buoyancy control in recreational scuba diving.\nSurface supplied divers are generally obliged to carry sufficient bailout gas to return to a place of safety if the main gas supply fails, and this is usually activated by opening a valve on the helmet or harness that is in easy reach of both hands. Unsurprisingly, the number of out of gas fatalities in surface supplied diving is very low. [19]\nBreathing gas quality problems [ edit ]\nContamination of the breathing gas will have effects that depend on the concentration, the ambient pressure, and the specific contaminants present. Carbon monoxide produced by overheating of the compressor, or by contamination of the intake air by internal combustion engine exhaust gas is a well known risk, and can be mitigated by using hopcalite catalyst in the high pressure filter. [30] [31] Contamination by carbon dioxide is unusual in open circuit breathing apparatus, as natural air usually has a low enough content not to be a problem at the ambient pressures of most dives. It is a relatively common problem for rebreathers, as the metabolically produced carbon dioxide in the exhaled gas must be removed chemically by the scrubber before the gas can be breathed again. Scrubber breakthrough can occur for a variety of reasons, most of them connected to user error, but some more likely due to design details of the specific unit. A slow buildup of carbon dioxide can usually be noticed by the diver in time to bail out, but sometimes the concentration can rise so rapidly that the diver is incapacitated before being able to bail out. [ citation needed ]\nUse of breathing gases other than those planned for the current depth range of a dive can have undesirable consequences. The oxygen concentration of a gas may be toxic or insufficient to support consciousness if used at an inappropriate depth, and the inert gas components will not be correctly accounted for in decompression calculations, which might result in decompression sickness. [32] Both oxygen toxicity and hypoxia may render the diver unconscious without warning, and decompression sickness symptoms may be debilitating if severe, and are generally unexpected. [ citation needed ]\nBreathing apparatus malfunctions [ edit ]\nSee also: Diving regulator § Malfunctions and failure modes , and Rebreather diving § Failure modes\nOpen circuit scuba is generally very reliable if correctly maintained and serviced, and tested before the dive. Maintenance and testing procedures are simple and few in number, nevertheless divers may neglect them due to complacency, distraction or incompetence. [ citation needed ]\nRebreather scuba is considerably more complex than open circuit scuba, and the number of failure modes is much greater. The complexity of routine maintenance, pre-dive setup and pre-dive testing are such that documentary checklists specific to the equipment model are strongly recommended by experts. [33] [34] Electronically mediated predive check sequences are available on some electronic closed circuit rebreathers, but even these occasionally fail to detect a latent problem. [35]\nSurface supplied diving equipment may provide a constant flow or demand regulated gas supply. The surface gas control panel allows alternative gas supplies to be connected if the primary supply fails, and a further backup supply is generally carried by the diver. This multiple redundancy reduces the number of ways the gas supply to the diver can be critically compromised, and further mitigation is provided by the standby diver, who can also supply emergency breathing gas. As a consequence, surface-supplied divers are very seldom critically affected by breathing gas supply failure. [19]\nBuoyancy problems [ edit ]\nSee also: Buoyancy compensator (diving) § Hazards\nInsufficient buoyancy is a problem for divers who must ascend through the water column without assistance from a lifting platform, a surface tender, or something they can climb. This effectively limits the problem to freedivers and untethered scuba divers. Insufficient buoyancy at the end of a dive can prevent the diver from surfacing before breathing gas runs out, cause the diver to sink to an unintended depth or cause a diver at the surface to be unable to stay afloat. Insufficient buoyancy at the end of a dive is usually due to diver error in carrying too much weight or to a major failure of the dry suit or buoyancy compensator (BC or BCD). Insufficient buoyancy at the start of a dive can also be caused by carrying too much weight, but can also be due to a poor match between mass of gas carried and volume of buoyancy compensator, which is usually only a problem with technical divers, who may start a dive with a relatively large mass of gas. A major flood of the dry suit can cause a sudden large loss of buoyancy at any time during a dive. A properly trained and equipped diver will be able to correct this either by BC inflation or weight shedding. Divers are trained to manage problems of insufficient buoyancy due to equipment malfunctions, and to adjust their weighting to suit the equipment used for a specific dive. The consequence of uncompensated insufficient buoyancy is usually drowning. Almost all fatalities due to insufficient buoyancy can be ascribed to diver error if the diver was conscious and able to act at the time that the problem was noticed. [18]\nExcessive buoyancy can be a problem for any diver who is constrained from making a direct uncontrolled ascent. It is a hazard for all divers who breath underwater at ambient pressure, as a rapid ascent can cause decompression illness . Excessive buoyancy at the start of a dive is usually caused by insufficient weighting, which is diver error. Loss of ballast weights can occur at any time during a dive, and can have various causes, depending on how the weights are carried, including voluntary shedding of too much weight in a perceived emergency. A third cause of excessive buoyancy, which develops during a dive and usually manifests at the end, during the ascent, is insufficient weighting to compensate for the mass of gas used during the dive. This can be almost always be ascribed to diver error, and usually occurs when a diver miscalculates the buoyancy increase due to gas usage, and does not carry sufficient weight to compensate. It is a common problem when unfamiliar equipment is used without a checkout dive with the cylinder nearly empty. Divers will often accept the recommendations for weighting given by the dive shop supplying the equipment, or base their weighting on similar equipment used in the past. For recreational divers who do not exceed the no-stop limit, this is seldom seriously harmful. At worst the ascent rate may be a little fast near the surface and they will be unable to do a safety stop, but for divers with a significant decompression obligation, it can have more serious consequences. Surface supplied divers who plan a dive with long decompression obligations usually carry weights which cannot easily be removed, to reduce the risk of accidentally losing them and becoming uncontrollably buoyant. The other common cause of excessive buoyancy which can occur at any time in a dive, is excess gas in the dry suit or buoyancy compensator. This can be caused by several factors, some of which can be classed as diver error, and others as equipment malfunction, but divers are trained to deal with these malfunctions as they are reasonably foreseeable, so failure to correct them when they occur is also generally a diver error in the wider sense. [18]\nBuoyancy compensator malfunction has been implicated in a significant number of fatal incidents, usually due to a problem with the inflator mechanism, but in some cases the BCD could not stay inflated. In most of these fatalities, the buoyancy compensator was not used competently, usually by over-inflation which caused an uncontrolled ascent, or deflating when more buoyancy was required at the surface. [36] Overweighting can also be classified as misuse of equipment. Inability to inflate the buoyancy compensator can also occur when the diver runs out of breathing gas, as the breathing gas supply is generally the inflation gas supply. This can complicate an emergency ascent, particularly if the diver is not immediately aware of the implications relating to buoyancy of breathing gas loss.\nBCD blowups can occur when the inflation valve sticks open. In most cases this can be quickly corrected, either by pulling the valve closed or by disconnecting the LP inflation hose, and if the system has a low flow rate when fully open, this is seldom a major problem, as it is possible to dump air faster than it flows into the BCD. However, some inflator systems have a high flow rate, and if these valves stick fully open, the diver may not be able to dump fast enough to prevent being dragged upwards, at which stage a positive feedback of expansion of gas already in the BCD and possibly also the suit may become unrecoverable. Attempts to fin downwards against the buoyancy are likely to trap gas in the BCD and suit. Ascents are safer if the diver is trimmed feet down and shoulders high to facilitate dumping from both suit and BCD.\nDouble bladder BCDs are used by some technical divers as a backup in case the primary fails by not retaining air. This can happen if the inflation hose tears or comes off, or the bladder has a major puncture near the top that cannot be compensated by trim. The problem with this form of equipment redundancy occurs when the diver inadvertently inflates or deflates the wrong bladder. It is also possible for the inflation valve of a secondary bladder with low pressure inflation supply to malfunction and leak gas into the bladder without the diver's input or knowledge, and the diver then finds it impossible to dump sufficient gas from what they mistakenly believe to be the inflated bladder. This risk can be avoided by not connecting a pressure supply hose to the inflator for the secondary bladder, by having a distinctly different style of inflator mechanism, by mounting it on the other side of the diver to the primary inflator, and by never using it underwater while the primary bladder is functional. The other way of managing this problem is to mount the two inflator valve units together, and basically always assume that both bladders have gas in then, so always dump from both at the same time. This may be problematic if the diver needs to deflate while inverted and the lower dump valves are not positioned to allow simultaneous operation.\nIf a dry suit is worn, the dry suit can be inflated as a substitute for the BCD in an emergency, but a dry suit is not well suited to operate at a good trim with a large amount of gas inside, and the risk of a runaway inverted ascent is significant. Remaining upright and ascending without delay is most likely to avoid complications.\nDivers who carry a delayed surface marker buoy (DSMB) can use it to signal the surface that they are ascending, and use it to positively control depth and ascent rate once deployed, by maintaining some tension in the line. The equipment is considered an important safety aid, but deployment is a period of relatively high risk, as if the line snags and stops unrolling the buoyancy may be sufficient to drag the diver up far enough to cause the expansion of the suit and BCD to get out of control, and if the diver lets go of the DSMB it will be lost. A spare DSMB and spool may be carried in case of this contingency. The risks of deploying the DSMB with the reel clipped to the diver are considered unacceptable by some, and this practice has been implicated in fatal accidents.\nThermal problems [ edit ]\nHypothermia\nOverheating ( hyperthermia ) is a less common problem, and is usually associated with special environments. It can be particularly problematic as the physiological response to overheating of sweating does not work in water or a diving suit where relative humidity rapidly reaches 100% and there can be no evaporative cooling. Hyperthermia can simply be avoided by recreational divers in almost all circumstances, as water temperature is normally known before entry, but professional divers may have work in water which is too hot to operate without artificial cooling. In some cases this can be done simply by running cooling water through a hot-water suit , but the situation can be complicated when the diver must also be isolated from environmental contamination. Cooling vests and \"tube suits\" have been used for this application. [1]\nScalding in hot water suits\nThis section needs expansion with: accidents and injuries caused by thermal problems. You can help by adding to it . ( May 2021 )\nHazardous tools and activities [ edit ]\nUnderwater cutting and welding activities involve the use of live electrical conductors exposed to the water in the close proximity of the diver using them. Electrocution is possible, though unlikely to be fatal. as the voltages are fairly low. They also involve extreme heat and the generation of explosive gases, which may accumulate under obstacles to their free escape, and may detonate, causing pressure trauma to the diver. Stringent precautions are required for using this equipment, including training in the appropriate procedures. Nevertheless, accidents occasionally happen. The equipment used and injuries manifested are pointers towards possible triggering events. [ citation needed ]\nProfessional divers are often required to assist with the lifting and placement of large, massive objects underwater during the course of their employment. This exposes them to hazards of impact, pinching and crushing. Trauma caused by such incidents is usually obvious and easily identified. In some cases the triggering incident is a lapse of procedure, other times it may be an unexpected environmental effect, though seldom unforeseeable. Occasionally a failure of properly tested, inspected and operated equipment may occur. Negligence is often contributory to such accidents. Recreational divers are usually not sufficiently trained to safely perform these tasks, and are at greater risk. Entanglement in a runaway buoyant lift is a hazard specifically of working with lift bags , and particularly when filling them with breathing gas from scuba cylinders carried by the diver. Filling a lift bag at depth can deplete the gas supply in a cylinder rapidly, so a dedicated cylinder should be used when this work must be done on scuba. [ citation needed ]\nHigh pressure water-jetting injuries are usually easy to recognise. Investigation of incidents involving such injuries is likely to include identifying procedural causes, or occasionally equipment malfunction, which may also have a procedural cause.

They may also be encountered by divers in the form of unexploded munitions of various ages and unknown stability.\nThis section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

It is very often the direct cause of death in diving accidents, but usually follows a series of events triggered by an event which need not necessarily have been fatal. Drowning is a diagnosis of exclusion, it is appropriate when other possibilities have been ruled out. In scuba diving drowning is usually the consequence of running out of breathing gas at depth or under an overhead barrier to a direct ascent to the surface, but can also occur as a consequence of loss of consciousness for any one of a variety of reasons followed by a compromised airway. In breath-hold diving, it usually occurs when the diver loses consciousness or reaches a state of hypercapnia severe enough to cause involuntary inhalation before reaching the surface. [10] The airway of a surface supplied diver is usually protected by the helmet or full-face mask, and consequently these divers should survive a loss of consciousness if rescued while a suitable breathing gas supply is available. [19]\nArterial gas embolism requires overextension and rupture of lung tissue, which in a healthy diver, can occur on ascent. A sufficient overexpansion of the lungs requires a simultaneous decrease in depth and failure to release gas from the lungs, so that the blood-air interface is ruptured while there is sufficient overpressure to force gas into pulmonary blood vessels against local blood pressure [10] It can also be caused by some lung pathologies. [ citation needed ]\nDecompression sickness requires supersaturation of tissues during the decompression of ascent, and bubble formation is affected by ascent rate and the amount of gas dissolved in the tissues during exposure to pressure while breathing. Presence of tissue bubbles during autopsy is not necessarily an indication of DCS as gas will come out of solution when a body is decompressed by recovering to the surface. Dive history as recorded by a personal dive computer or bottom timer can indicate a probability of gas bubbles being a consequence of decompression sickness, lung overpressure induced arterial gas embolism or an artifact of post mortem recovery decompression. [10]\nParadoxical gas embolism – venous blood with bubbles which would be asymptomatic if filtered through the pulmonary circulation passing through a patent foramen ovale into the systemic circulation during exertion during ascent or after surfacing, and then lodge in critical tissues where they may grow by diffusion processes. [10] Divers are often unaware of a PFO, and there is not generally a requirement to be tested for PFO for recreational or professional divers as it is not a disqualification for diving.\nCardiovascular disease: The most common natural disease process associated with diving fatalities. Often sudden death is the first indication of cardiovascular disease, but sometimes the diver had known problems but chose to continue diving. In divers older than 35 years cardiovascular disease is second only to drowning as the primary cause of death, and is frequently implicated in drownings. [10]\nCarbon monoxide poisoning is rare, but occasionally occurs due to contaminated breathing gas. Partial pressure in the breathing gas is increased in proportion to depth, and concentrations that might be tolerated at the surface could be lethal at depth. Breathing gas tests can confirm or exclude the presence of carbon monoxide in toxic concentrations. [10]\nMechanical trauma is usually obvious when it is the direct cause of death, but it is possible for less obvious injury to cause a short-term reduction in the level of consciousness sufficient for the diver to be unable to avoid drowning, or to hinder the diver from taking the necessary action.\nGeneral findings [ edit ]\nFurther information: Scuba diving fatalities § Manner of death\nThe direct cause of death is not usually the ultimate aim of the investigation. A finding of drowning, gas embolism or decompression sickness by the autopsy opens the question of why that happened, and whether it could or should have been avoidable. The equipment, procedures and training associated with diving are specifically intended to prevent drowning, barotrauma and decompression sickness, and a fatality caused by one of these is an indication that the system failed in some way. To be useful in preventing similar incidents, it is necessary to find out how and why the system failed. In non-fatal accidents, this is the primary purpose of the investigation. [1] [5] [7] [6]\nBuddy separation is frequently associated with recreational diving incidents. [10] This can be interpreted to indicate that the buddy system as commonly practised by recreational divers is flawed. Either the divers are not effectively adhering to the buddy system as specified by the training agencies, or the circumstances of the dive were beyond the capacity of the divers to remain together, which implies that the divers were not technically competent to perform that dive. [37] This problem is exacerbated by arbitrary pairing of strangers to dive as buddies by dive professionals who are not familiar with the competence of the divers beyond the certification they have produced when booking the dive. The dive professionals are usually indemnified by a waiver/release that the divers are required to sign as a condition of service, leaving the divers vulnerable to the consequences of being paired with an incompetent or negligent buddy, or buddies who have been trained in slightly different procedures, and may be unfamiliar with each other's equipment and intentions. [13] [37] [38] The reaction to this problem includes the two extremes – The DIR philosophy of strict adherence to a standardised system of procedures and equipment, and not diving with anyone who does not use the same system, and the self-reliant route, where the diver elects to dive as if on their own, not relying on the buddy for assistance, and carrying sufficient equipment redundancy to manage reasonably foreseeable incidents unaided. These divers may choose to dive solo rather than be burdened by a buddy of unknown competence or known incompetence, [37] but may be obstructed in this choice by legislation or terms and conditions of service. [39] [40]\nA common finding in recreational diving is human error, most often of the victim. [41] In some cases the diver was not competent for the specific activity due to lack of appropriate training, in others the scope of the training was appropriate but the diver 's skills were insufficient at the time. Even when equipment problems are involved, they are usually due to human error, either by misuse, failure to check functionality, or inappropriate reaction to a problem. [18] In professional diving, although there are considerably more safeguards required, and the incidence of accidents is lower, human error remains a major contributor, but it is sometimes error by other members of the dive team.\nCompetence of investigators [ edit ]\nFatal scuba diving accidents are uncommon, fatal surface-supplied diving accidents are even less common, and training of forensic investigators and pathologists does not generally include the relevant skills and specialist knowledge. Specialist workshops have been run to provide a better understanding of diving physiology and pathophysiology, epidemiology, gathering of pertinent history, familiarization with dive equipment, modification of autopsy protocol, interpretation of the findings, and determination of the most likely cause of death. [42]\nThe competence of investigators of diving accidents and incidents is usually limited to a subset of the competence to determine criminal or civil liability. This should be taken into account when presenting evidence, and investigators, expert witnesses, and the court or board of inquiry should ensure that opinions beyond the scope of their competence are specified as such so that they may be disregarded when making a judgement. [43]\nThis section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( October 2019 )\nNear miss reports [ edit ]\nFor every incident in which someone is injured of killed, it has been estimated that a relatively large number of \" near miss \" incidents occur, which the diver manages well enough to avoid harm. In many cases these can be ascribed to inherent hazards of diving , and the responses which compensated for the hazardous event are standard diving procedures , correctly and promptly applied, but there are also situations where something unforeseen, not immediately explicable, or previously considered highly improbable, occurs. Ideally these incidents will be recorded, analysed for cause, reported, and the results made public, so that similar incidents can be avoided in the future. [4] This tends to happen more consistently in professional diving, where occupational health and safety concerns are more closely monitored, and in organisations with an established safety culture .\nSee also [ edit ]\nAccident  – Unforeseen event, often with a negative outcome\nAccident analysis  – Process to determine the causes of accidents to prevent recurrence\nChain of events (accident analysis)  – Series of contributing factors leading to an undesired outcome\nCivil liability in recreational diving  – Legal duty of care, negligence and liability in recreational diving\nDiving safety  – Risk management of underwater diving activities\nFailure mode and effects analysis  – Analysis of potential system failures\nForensic science  – Application of science to criminal and civil laws\nHuman factors and ergonomics  – Designing systems to suit their users\nHuman reliability  – Factor in safety, ergonomics and system resilience\nIncident pit  – Conceptual model for explaining incident development and recovery\nOccupational safety and health  – Field concerned with the safety, health and welfare of people at work\nScuba diving fatalities  – Deaths occurring while scuba diving or as a consequence of scuba diving\nSwiss cheese model  – Model used in risk analysis\nReferences [ edit ]\n^ a\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\nh\ni\nj\nk\nl\nm\nn\no\np\nBarsky, Steven; Neuman, Tom (2003).

Your primary medical insurance may exclude scuba diving as a hazardous recreational activity and/or may not provide coverage when you are traveling out of the country. If it does provide coverage, it may pay only a minimal amount for chamber treatments. There are also often large out-of-pocket payments for deductibles and co-pays.

        "content":"Dive Insurance | Why Do You Need Diving Insurance Cover?\nHOME\nCOURSES\nDIVING\nDIVE SITES\nEQUIPMENT\nINJURIES\nLESSONS\nSEA LIFE\nHome › A-Z of Scuba Diving › Insurance for Divers\nInsurance for Scuba Divers\nFact: Recreational scuba has a \"relatively\" low serious incident rate. Nonetheless, a range of unpredictable factors can increase the likelihood of having a diving accident.\nThus, if you're asking yourself \"why do I need dive insurance\" this guide explains why some kind of diving accident insurance for scuba divers should be part of your checklist.\nReasons Why All Divers Should Be Insured\nLet's assume you have some medical coverage. Even so, many policies exclude scuba diving as being a \"hazardous recreational activity\".\nPlus, companies that do provide cover for medical costs, might:\nOnly pay a minimum amount for recompression chamber treatments.\nCharge excessive out-of-pocket payments (e.g. for deductibles and copays).\nFurthermore, some dive insurance packages might fail to provide you with adequate cover when traveling overseas.\nIn many countries, it is a legal requirement for all divers to have suitable diving insurance cover. It will either be a short-term policy or some kind of annual coverage.\nNote : Short term scuba insurance policies are more appropriate for people participating in an introductory course (e.g. as an occasional activity) or as part of regular holiday diving activities .\nWhat Causes Most Diving Accidents?\nSome common causes of serious dive accidents include swimming in murky water, fighting strong ocean currents, and equipment failure. But, by far the most important reason to have insurance cover is for when \" diver mistakes \" occur.\nPut another way :\nScuba diving is not classed as a dangerous sport, per se. But, you can also include errors such as poor judgement, inadequate preparation, a lack of proper training, and using dangerous or inappropriate equipment.\nOur team at \" Private Scuba \" encourages all participants in the industry to get personal insurance cover. Moreover, using safe diving techniques help to reduce the frequency of such incidents. Our safety tips include:\nTaking out adequate travel and scuba accident insurance and keeping your policy number and emergency contact details handy.\nChecking your gear for proper use and having it serviced regularly (see our scuba safety tips ).\nAlways diving with a buddy and having direct access to the surface at all times.\nStaying within the limits of your scuba training level (depth and equipment) and staying physically fit (e.g. have regular medical checkups).\nParticipating in the PADI Rescue Diver Course and respecting the aquatic marine life and environment (e.g. refrain from touching unfamiliar creatures).\nBeing properly hydrated while scuba diving and avoiding excessive exposure to alcohol, cigarette smoke, and caffeine.\nThat said, scuba accidents do not happen on a regular basis. The annual figures of injury reports and scuba diving deaths per year are comparatively low.\nPaying for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy\nPrudent divers will always use good judgment, conduct proper pre-dive planning, perform the basic safety checks, and buy comprehensive scuba accident insurance.\nHaving recompression treatment in a hyperbaric chamber is expensive. Furthermore, it is not always immediately available - depending on the remoteness of many worldwide diving destinations .\nIn some of the most severe incidents, it may be necessary to use an air ambulance to get the patient to proper hospital care. As a result, the final journey home could escalate the costs in excess of $100,000.\nThere is no shortage of companies that offer dive accident insurance for scuba divers. In fact, most of them have an easy online signup facility (details below).\nThis part is important :\nScuba diving insurance may not be necessary in all circumstances. But, to be effective and adequate, the coverage needs to be appropriate for the type of diving you anticipate doing and for the area that you will travel to.\nFurthermore, it is worth checking how well equipped are the boats that you may be using and whether there is re-compression treatment available in your chosen destination.\nFor example :\nWill there be oxygen on board and would it be enough to cover the journey back to shore (e.g. before reaching land-based EMS)?\nIn the main, most reputable operators have emergency oxygen supplies and well stocked first aid kits on board. They also have trained staff capable of administering it to someone in need.\nThere is no substitution for proper planning and the prevention of diving accidents. Combined with safe practices, participants will benefit from professional training in rescue techniques and emergency medical treatment.\nImportant : Another section explains how to create and operate the PADI Emergency Action Plan as part of your scuba education.\nHow to Get Scuba Diving Insurance\nThe DAN Dive Accident Insurance Program protects divers against a range of unpredictable expenses. As a result, members who join the Divers Alert Network (DAN) get access to several different insurance plans.\nSingle Trip Insurance\nDAN single trip plans provide vital cover while on a scuba vacation. So, being insured means you can avoid having unforeseen diving incidents completely ruin your holiday.\nAnnual Travel Insurance\nIt is not uncommon for divers to take multiple dive trips throughout the year. DAN's annual insurance plan covers:\nTrip cancellation and interruption.\nBaggage and sporting equipment.\nEmergency assistance and transportation (e.g. repatriation).\nDive Equipment Insurance\nYou will be investing a lot of time and money when purchasing dive gear (especially camera equipment). Despite not being able to avoid certain types of accidents, you can protect your gear with DAN.\nProfessional Liability Insurance\nIf you are planning on becoming a dive professional you will most likely need to be insured. You can also customise the plan with a technical diving endorsement and excess liability coverage.\nDAN® Dive Accident Insurance\nDivers Alert Network is a non-profit insurance company that offers basic injury insurance and professional liability coverage.\nTheir dive insurance policies cover worldwide scuba travel, equipment loss, and accident health and safety in scuba diving (including repatriation). DAN diving insurance price starts from $30 per person per year.\nDAN Emergency Hotline (+1-919-684-9111).\nScuba Diving Travel Medical Insurance\nDespite being inherently safe, diving accidents happen. But, you can protect yourself and your equipment should you have a bad day.\nNote : Visit the Scuba Diving Travel Medical Insurance website for feature rich and cost effective packages.\nInsurance Cover for Scuba Businesses\nAnother section explains how to start a scuba diving business in greater detail. But, most insurance plans for commercial enterprises will include:\nThe standard plan offers coverage for:\nDecompression illness (DCI) which includes both arterial gas embolism (AGE) and decompression sickness (DCS) sustained on a covered or repetitive dive series to a maximum depth of forty (40) metres.\nLimited hyperbaric fees and physicians and medical supplies used in the treatment of DCS.\nThe master plan provides coverage for:\nDecompression illness and all covered in-water injuries sustained on a covered or repetitive dive series to a maximum depth of fifty (50) metres.\nA master plan normally has death or dismemberment benefits arising from a covered diving accident.\nThe preferred plan has extra benefits covering:\nAccidental death and dismemberment resulting from a covered diving accident to any depth, provided that the insured held appropriate certification for it, and was using appropriate breathing gas mixes and equipment during the submersion or repetitive dive series.\nDiver Comments and Feedback\nEnjoyed the read thanks! I wasn't sure about scuba insurance because I only make a few dives a year. But, this article emphasises how expensive treatment can be if things go wrong under water.\nDean Winters\nFlorida\nNote : We welcome your comments and questions.

Simply put, it refers to the recorded deaths that happen during a scuba dive (or as a consequence of the activities involving divers).\nYet, current scuba diving risks statistics prove that it is a rare occurrence. Nonetheless, the most common cause of diver fatality is human error (often due miscalculations in gas management or poor buoyancy control).\nFurthermore, in older divers, data shows that cardiac events ( scuba diving with heart conditions ) account for about 25% of diving fatalities each year.\nHere's the good news :\nStatistically speaking, divers who use open circuit scuba are unlikely to die due to a failure of their equipment. But, forgetting (or neglecting) to maintain your dive gear will increase the risk of you having an incident underwater.\nNote : Some divers ask ' is scuba diving insurance necessary ' and is it a legal requirement? We can answer that by pointing out that diver fatalities can have enormous financial ramifications (e.g. through a loss of income, business bankruptcy, and litigation costs).\nDiving Incidents, Injuries, and Fatalities\nFor one reason or another, there is no way of completely eliminating the risk of dying through recreational scuba , commercial diving , freediving , or snorkeling activities .\nIn spite of this, we can mitigate the likelihood of serious injury or death through a combination of education and safe diving practices.\nHere's the thing :\nIn fact, severe diving injuries and scuba fatalities are rare. Even so, they do happen - often when there are no obvious contributing factors.\nAll divers need to understand the pitfalls and hazards. Hence, there are common mistakes and misfortunes that factor in almost all diving accidents and incidents - and we should learn from these insights.\nDAN Annual Diving Report [2020]\nEvery year, many of the victims and witnesses involved in diving mishaps send incident reports to the Diver Alert Network (DAN).\nAs a result, many of the advances in diver education have come about by tracking the most serious injuries and diving-related fatalities within the community.\nImportant : We are building a scuba database of recent diving accidents which contains vital insights into actual case summaries and how we can learn from the misfortunes of other divers.\nHow Many People Die from Scuba Diving?\nReleasing the descriptive statistics of known facts about scuba deaths per year is one of the key roles of Divers Alert Network (DAN).\nThe DAN Annual Diving Report on Diving Fatalities, Injuries, and Incidents highlights the total number of scuba diving deaths worldwide by region and country.\nIt also states how many of the circumstances and associated risks could have been reduced - or avoided altogether.\nDAN's data collection process starts when a diving death has been identified. In most cases, identification arises through scuba news stories , forums, internet alerts, and affiliated organisations (e.g. members of the public, county medical examiners).\nSo, how dangerous is diving?\nWell, scuba is a 'relatively' safe sport when it's undertaken in a responsible manner. Even so, there's a lot more we can do to make our dives free of accidents, scuba diving related injuries , and fatalities.\nExpressed as a percentage, common identifiable triggers that initiated a combination of events leading to scuba diving death statistics are as follows:\nInsufficient gas (41%)\nEntrapment (20%)\nEquipment problems (15%)\nAs a result, all divers should carefully consider the diving decisions they make and take greater care in the water.\nImportant : New divers can avoid most of the severe risks associated with learning to dive by adhering to the number one rule of scuba diving !\nTotal Number of Collected Fatalities Worldwide\nAccording to DAN incident reporting, the geographical and seasonal distribution of scuba fatalities in 2018 was 189 diving deaths.\nIn fact, the number of decedents reported as taking place in the United States (or Canada) was less than in previous years.\nDIVER CLASSIFICATIONS\nUNITED STATES & CANADA\nOTHER COUNTRIES\nTOTAL\nRecreational\n55\n45\n100\nBreath-hold\n29\n30\n59\nCommercial\n6\n7\n13\nPublic Safety\n1\n11\n12\nMilitary\n0\n1\n1\nNot Reported/Unknown\n1\n3\n4\nTotal\n92\n97\n189\nThis is some of the notable data about the distribution of fatalities by age and sex worldwide:\n80% of decedents (people who are no longer alive) were male.\nA total of 67% of the fatalities recorded were fifty (50) years of age or older.\nThe average age was fifty four (54) years (median 56).\nThe youngest fatality was ten (10) years old and the oldest was seventy three (73) years old.\nThe number of accidental (or due to misadventure) diving deaths for citizens in countries outside of the United States and Canada:\nMexico (5)\nCayman Islands (2)\nNetherlands Antilles (1)\nBelize (1)\nBahamas (1)\nIndonesia (1)\nMalaysia (1)\nPhilippines (1)\nNote : The diagram and charts show how many people die scuba diving each year. The latest data shows 80% of recorded and known cases were male and 20% were female (USA and Canada). It also concludes that Florida had the highest scuba diving fatality rate (e.g. at Monroe, Palm Beach, and Broward) in the United States.\nScuba Diving Accidents Statistics and Causes\nThe scuba diving fatality rate shows that scuba deaths are 'comparatively' uncommon. Even so, most of the mishaps occur as a direct result from one of three (or all) factors:\nLack of concentration\nOverconfidence\nSheer negligence\nOne noteworthy statistic in dive deaths is that about 50% of those recorded were for divers who had made less than twenty (20) dives.\nPut another way :\nThis statistical analysis masks (pun intended) the basic fact that 50% of these deaths were associated with divers who already had some experience (i.e. they had logged more than 20 dives).\nThe exact numerical input for the 50% remains a little unclear. So, was it for a fewer or greater number for any specific level of qualification?\nWhat is worth noting, however, is that serious injury or even death can happen to any diver - and at any of the scuba certification levels .\nStatistics equating scuba diving deaths a year with other accidents resulting in death (e.g. road deaths), might be pointless and prove nothing.\nIn fact, it may be more important to take notice of the insurance companies. Most of them place scuba diving near to the top of dangerous sports/pastimes. Yet, the United States Parachuting Association (USPA) disclosed that skydives end in fatality more often (when compared to scuba deaths per year).\nThe last time we checked, the risk of dying from scuba diving activities rated as one (1) in every 200,000 dives. That sounds like a risk worth taking!\nHow Do Scuba Divers Die?\nYou may now be wondering 'what are the odds of dying while scuba diving'? Information and data from the \" Diving Medicine for Scuba Divers \" showed:\n1% of divers died while they were attempting a rescue.\n5% died while cave diving.\n10% had received advice that they were medically unfit to go diving.\n10% were 'under trained' when they died.\n25% got into difficulty at the surface beforehand.\n50% failed to inflate their buoyancy compensator .\n50% actually died at the surface (not under water).\n86% were alone when they died - diving solo or got separated (e.g. misused the buddy system ).\n90% of the victims died with their weight belt still in place (e.g. they failed to release it).\nNote : Despite being mandatory in most countries, we always recommend having adequate insurance cover for scuba divers .\nPrevious Health Conditions\nWhat then, are the typical reasons for mortalities? In fact, there is rarely a single determining factor that actually causes diver deaths.\nMore often than not, there are multiple factors - interwoven and intrinsically linked. But, together they can deteriorate and turn a 'minor incident' into a catastrophic death!\nIn fact, this disastrous thesis is borne out by the well-respected Director of Research at 'DAN' - Dr. Petar Denoble, who suggests:\n\"Whilst each accident may be different, and some occur in isolation and in an instant, many can be represented as a multiple chain of events that lead to a deadly outcome. Removing any link from that chain may change the outcome and render it 'survivable'.\"\nDiving in a bit deeper :\nLet's first consider previous health conditions not 'directly' connected with diving. Recent research shows that a large proportion of scuba related deaths are associated with people who are suffering some kind of poor health pre-condition.\nIn normal circumstances, these conditions would be somewhat controllable - or at least not subject to any intense medical attention.\nThey include the usual array of lifestyle complaints, such as obesity, high blood pressure, and coronary heart disease (CHD).\nEven less serious complaints, such as the common cold, can also take on a new mantle when undertaking in-water activities.\nThis is the important part :\nAs much as anything, diving and having a heart attack is one of the health issues that recreational scuba divers should be concerned about the most.\nYou might expect that decompression illness (e.g. the bends ), or an air embolism would create the highest risk of mortality for scuba divers.\nIn fact, data from the Divers Alert Network (DAN) suggests that cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the cause of 15% of scuba fatalities.\nIt includes a range of significant medical health problems, but the common issues to be concerned about are:\nCoronary artery disease\nHypertension (high blood pressure)\nTransient ischemic attack (stroke)\nFurthermore, elevated cholesterol levels, age (40+), and smoking, are all attributed to the most common risk factors.\nIn addition to taking frequent medical evaluations, other risk-reducing steps you can take include:\nAvoiding refined sugar.\nEating a healthy balanced diet.\nReducing exposure to cigarette smoke .\nTaking regular exercise.\nBuoyancy Control and Air Supply Problems\nA wide range of potential problems can give rise to extreme distress. Typically, they include rapid ascents (or descents), insufficient air supply, and not being able to gauge a proper response - frequently due to panic.\nOften, the result will be an uncontrolled ascent. Experts have cited this as being a major contributory factor that results in scuba diver deaths.\nEvents which act as the trigger can be attributed to poor experience, and in some cases, super-confidence in one's ability (e.g. negligence).\nWhy is this important?\nIn a nutshell, it means you are diving beyond your safe limit. It can be in a variety of situations (e.g. wreck penetration ) or at different skill or experience levels.\nThe fact is that on descent, gas in the body cavities will compress. Then, upon descent it will expand. Thus, in extreme cases of rapid descent or ascent, this can cause severe tissue damage - or death!\nEquipment Malfunction or Improper Use\nScuba diving equipment failure as a direct cause of death is a rare issue. Even so, you should never use old or poorly-maintained dive gear.\nMore often than not, the diver will be unaware of the equipment malfunction, or over confident in its use.\nCertain situations can arise that start a chain of events leading to a stressed or panic reaction. Comfort and familiarity with all the different parts of scuba equipment is of paramount importance. Thus, you should be 'at one' with your dive gear.\nNote : Another section explains the dangers of ' deadly tank valve turns ' and how the practice is often taken for granted - even by experienced divers.\nLack of Understanding: Hostile Environments\nFloating at the surface of a pool or in open water, such as snorkel swimming , is a pastime that is rightfully enjoyed by many.\nBeing a reasonable swimmer, and staying within the confines of your own abilities, is generally accepted as being both pleasurable and safe. Yet, snorkeling accidents and deaths still happen!\nThink of it like this. Once you submerge your body underwater, you are not 'swimming underwater'. In fact, you have entered an environment for which you and your body were not made.\nKey takeaway :\nThe dangerous 'power' of water is not understood and realised by most, especially people who don't know how to scuba . Certain environmental factors also contribute to fatalities, including:\nCaves\nChallenging entries and exits\nCold temperatures\nEntrapment\nMarine animal injuries (e.g. crown of thorns starfish sting , shark bites )\nNight diving\nUnderwater entanglements\nAs an example, those who commit suicide by jumping into water from high bridges, usually die from impact injuries. Thus, they are not officially recorded as drowning deaths per year.\nSubmerging your body in water brings about many physical and mental changes. It also applies to people with healthy bodies, even when wearing the very best equipment that money can buy.\nSo, even modern scuba equipment cannot fully negate the effects of intense pressure. All it can do is make you feel as comfortable as possible with the pleasures of going down in the deep blue sea.\nWhat is the Deadliest Dive Site in the World?\nThere is a famous diving location called the 'Blue Hole' in Egypt. It is a submarine sinkhole situated a few kilometres north of Dahab, on the coast of the Red Sea.\nEven though there is a shallow opening to the sea at about six metres (20 feet) deep, the maximum depth inside the hole is a little over 100 metres (328 feet).\nIt is one of the most popular destinations for scuba divers and freedivers in the world. There is no shortage of vibrant coral formations and reef fishes.\nBut, the Blue Hole has the infamous reputation of having the most diver fatalities at the same site. Recent estimates suggest up to two hundred (200) deaths.\nCave Diving Fatality Rate\nReliable information about the total number of cave diving deaths worldwide is rather limited. The data and statistics that do exist seem to suggest that following accepted protocols is keeping the cave diver mortality rate low.\nNonetheless, some of the known contributing factors include:\nFailing to use a continuous guideline back to open water (especially among untrained divers who go inside caves).\nExcessive depth (including trained cave divers).\nRunning out of gas before reaching the cave exit (e.g. getting lost, panic).\nLong ago, cave-diving analysis showed around 90% of cave diving accidents were attributed to untrained divers. Since the year 2000, the trend of accidents has reversed and now involves around 80% of trained cave divers.\nThe resultant increase of cave-diving accidents averaged at 2.5 fatalities per year (2011). But, the fatality rate reached a peak annual rate the following year (2012) with more than twenty (20) recorded deaths.\nFreediving Deaths Per Year Worldwide\nAs much as anything, the personal level of specialised training influences the depth limits for most breath-hold divers.\nThat said, the International association for the Development of Apnea (AIDA) recognises several disciplines within freediving competitions .\nThe following lists of breath-hold fatalities show the most notable locations around the world where fatal incidents occurred the most:\nUnited States (22)\nCayman Islands (9)\nNew Zealand (6)\nAustralia (5)\nMexico (3)\nMalta (2)\nSeychelles (1)\nRecent statistics released by DAN show that the distribution of breath-hold fatalities by activity category in 2018 were as follows:\nFreediving (18)\nSnorkeling (42)\nDAN statistics show that the distribution of freediving fatalities by activity category in 2018 were as follows:\nSpearfishing (including harvesting) (12)\nPleasure and sightseeing adventures (2)\nDuring freediving training activities (1)\nUnknown (3)\nImportant : Another section contains information about PADI® Freediving Courses and we have an article with tips for freediving with sharks in open water environments.\nCONCLUSION: SCUBA DIVING DEATHS\nThe overriding majority of scuba fatalities occur in older divers and are related to health and fitness issues.\nHence, a healthy lifestyle, staying fit, and having regular medical checkups are the minimum prerequisites for life-long, healthy participation in scuba diving.\nSummaries about Diving Hazards\nWhatever your diving abilities and experience - as with driving - accidents can and do happen. Accidents do not pick and choose. No one is immune!\nGlib statistics can prove or disprove anything. But, an estimate worth taking note of is the fact that there is one diving death per 200,000 dives. Even so, that does not mean you have two hundred thousand lives.\nSome will die on their first or second dive. Whilst others, and their fellow divers, may log a few thousand during their lifetime.\nAnd why is this so?\nScuba diving risks statistics prove that it's a fairly even spread between experienced and non-experienced divers. Still, there is a greater likelihood that the underwater incidents that happen to experienced divers may be more life-threatening.\nPut simply, it is because man will be man, and most men want to go that one step further than before. It is part of human nature!\nRelated Information and Help Guides\nHow Would You Most Efficiently Provide Oxygen to a Breathing, Injured Diver?\nLung Overexpansion Injury Symptoms and Treatment\nWhat are the Typical Signs and Symptoms of a Person in Shock?\nNote : The main section contains a comprehensive list of common scuba diving injuries that form part of an effective diving accident management flowchart .\nDivers also enjoyed reading about...\nCONTACT | PRIVACY | SITEMAP\n© 2003 - 2024\n"},

Knowing how to recognize and appropriately respond to diving injuries may benefit you or someone you care about.\nThe most common issues reported via email and Divers Alert Network’s Emergency Hotline are ear and sinus barotrauma, decompression sickness, and marine envenomation.\n1. Ear and Sinus Barotrauma\nEars feel “full” or like they have water in them\nSevere ear pain\nDizziness, vertigo, nausea\nMuffled hearing, hearing loss, ringing in the ear\nRed or swollen external ear\nBlood or fluid oozing from ear\nPain when swallowing\nIf you or another diver experience any of the following symptoms, stop diving and seek medical care – ideally from an ear nose and throat specialist. After ruling out an infection, the doctor may recommend nasal steroid sprays, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, a hot compress, or oral decongestants like pseudoephedrine. Avoid ear barotrauma by equalizing early and often. Never force your descent and avoid using decongestants. Learn more about ear barotrauma .\n2. Decompression Sickness  (aka The Bends)\nDecompression sickness describes injuries resulting from a rapid decrease in surrounding pressure. Nitrogen absorbed by the body at depth comes out of solution and forms bubbles in body tissues and the bloodstream.\nDCS occurs most often when a diver pushes depth and time limits, but it can occur without obvious cause. For example: flying in a commercial airplane that experiences a sudden loss of pressure or flying too soon after diving can cause DCS because the cabin pressure is less than the pressure at sea level. This doesn’t happen frequently, but it is a known cause.\nSymptoms of DCS may include: skin rash, itching, joint pain, dizziness, fatigue, and bladder problems. These symptoms usually occur within one hour after surfacing, but can be delayed up to 24 hours.\nDenial is arguably the worst “symptom” of DCS as the sooner DCS is treated, the more likely it is the diver will make a full recovery. Oxygen first aid is essential and may reduce symptoms; however, O2 is not a substitute for a full evaluation by a medical professional. Always contact DAN or a dive physician if signs of DCS are observed – even if they’ve diminished.\nRead more about decompression sickness and treatment .\n3. Marine Envenomation\nMany marine animals use toxins for self-defense or for prey capture. Envenomation occurs when direct contact is made and the venom or toxin is injected by bite, puncture or sting. Injuries typically occur as divers are entering or exiting the water, but they can also happen when a diver accidentally or deliberately attempts to handle an animal. Envenomations usually cause itching, burning, or other irritation. Rarely do life-threatening reactions occur. Coral scrapes are perhaps the most common marine life-related injury experienced by divers and snorkelers. Cuts and scrapes from coral and barnacles can fester like a cat scratch – taking weeks or even months to heal without proper treatment. Spine punctures and stings are another common marine life injury.\nHow to treat:\nCarefully remove the spine or stinger (not recommended for stingray spines)\nImmerse the wound in non-scalding hot water: 110 – 113 F / 43.3 – 45 C (to tolerance)\nDAN encourages divers of all levels to get first-aid training and be prepared to respond to diving injuries, including first aid for marine life injuries . However, if the injured diver is weak, vomiting, short of breath, or acts intoxicated, seek immediate medical care.\nMost diving injuries are preventable. Breathe constantly, equalize regularly, and avoid contact with marine life, and ascend slowly.

Diving involves some inherent risk, so it’s incredibly important that we always have scuba diving insurance for unexpected situations.\nDuring the pandemic, travel insurance (and therefore also scuba diving insurance) became slightly more difficult to navigate. Many insurers wouldn’t cover cancellations in relation to Covid, and some also wouldn’t cover your healthcare if you became infected whilst travelling.\nWith this in mind, divers looking for insurance understandably have a lot of questions. Luckily we’re here to help answer some of those questions, with the help of Shannen from  DiveAssure.  Read on to learn more about why it’s important to have a scuba diving policy, what DiveAssure can offer with their coverage, and how insurance coverage has changed in response to Covid.\nChoose a Specific Dive Insurance Policy\nA quick search on an insurance comparison website will show you that there are countless providers on offer when it comes to travel insurance, and many of these generic travel policies will provide scuba diving cover within their included activities.\nHowever, once you get into the small print they’re often not comprehensive enough to cover the medical complications that can occur from diving accidents, or they have limitations such as depth limits which may not match your certification level.\nDivers also tend to carry expensive equipment, so the value of our luggage can be considerably higher than a normal lost baggage claim. Here’s what Shannen had to say about the benefits of a dive policy as opposed to relying on generic travel coverage:\nGTS: Why should every diver have specific dive insurance, rather than diving being covered on a travel policy?\nShannen: “Unlike DiveAssure, general travel insurance doesn’t offer the extensive coverage divers require when traveling abroad. Often, diving is not a covered event or the limits of cover are not sufficient for chamber and/or evacuations which can be costly.\nAt DiveAssure, we make sure to offer all the necessary coverages for divers in one membership. Including but not limited to: lost diving days, medical assistance for diving and non-diving incidents, lost/delayed diving gear, specialized liveaboard coverage, cancellation/interruption of your trip, and much more.”\nMany of the members of our  Girls that Scuba Facebook group  can testify to the importance of having dive specific insurance – a quick search of the word “insurance” brings up numerous posts of divers who are grateful that they had insurance in a dive accident scenario.\nWhilst we all hope it will never happen to us, the reality is that even the safest diver may find themselves in a situation where they need medical help, and having the correct, comprehensive insurance can save you from financially crippling medical bills.\nChoosing a Dive Insurance Provider\nIn contrast to the countless regular travel insurance providers, the choice of dive-specific insurers is much smaller. It’s important to do your research and compare policies to ensure you’re getting the right coverage for you and your trip(s), as not all dive insurers are created equal, and some will have better policies for your specific needs.\nGTS: What sets DiveAssure’s cover apart from other dive insurance offerings?\nShannen: “Based on over 20 years of service dedicated exclusively to diving insurance and with expertise gained through insuring hundreds of thousands of divers in the USA and all over the world, you are guaranteed the best available programs, designed specifically for divers.”\n“Should you require our help with claims or emergencies you will find that our dedication and knowledge of diving and dive-travel insurance makes a significant difference.”\n“We offer  a variety of insurance plans  to suit your specific needs, from basic diving accident insurance or a single dive-trip insurance, to premium annual multi-trip travel insurance. Our travel plans can closely match the cost of your trip.”\n“For those going on a liveaboard trip we offer our exclusive Liveaboard Rider with specific coverage of unique scenarios such as missing the boat’s departure and lost diving days due to many reasons.”\nCovid Coverage on Dive Policies\nAs well as the obvious risk of illness due to infection, the pandemic brought with it a whole host of travel related issues, including cancellation due to catching the virus, quarantining due to exposure, last minute trip cancellation due to border closures – the list is almost endless.\nWithin the dive insurance world, DiveAssure is offering some of the best Covid related coverage, and Shannen shared with us some of the specifics of their policies:\nGTS: What additional Covid coverage is in place on your diving and travel policies?\nShannen: “Our  Dive-Travel plans  offer trip cancellation/interruption due to contracting Covid-19 before your trip. We offer excellent limits for non-diving accidents/incidents which includes contracting Covid-19 while on a covered trip and quarantine expenses.”\nFor more information on what DiveAssure covers in relation to Covid-19,  read their notice here.\nDiveAssure are one of the many brands included on our  Girls that Scuba Membership Platform , which is the first of its kind within the scuba industry.

In aeromedicine, a pilot is considered “unfit to fly” when the cardiovascular event risk exceeds one percent per annum, the so-called 1% rule. In diving no formal limits to cardiovascular risk have been established. Cardiovascular risk of divers can be calculated using the modified Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Risk of Harm formula: risk of harm (RH: cardiovascular fatality rate per year during diving: number × 10-5 divers/year) = time diving (TD: number of dives × 10-4) × sudden cardiac incapacitation (SCI: cardiovascular diver event rate per year (number × 10-5/year). The SCI and thus the RH are strongly dependent on age. Using the CCS criterion for RH, 5 × 10-5 divers/year, and considering an average of 25 dives per year per diver, the calculated maximum acceptable SCI is 2%/year, consistent with current practice for dive medical examinations. If the SCI were to exceed 2%/year, a diver could be considered “unfit to dive,” which could particularly benefit older (≥ 50 years) divers, in whom cardiovascular risk factors are often not properly treated. For the prevention of fatal diving accidents due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, a dive medical examination is of limited value for young (<50 years) divers who have no cardiovascular risk factors. Introducing a cardiovascular risk management system for divers may achieve a reduction in fatal diving accidents that result from cardiovascular disease in older divers engaged in both recreational and professional diving.\nRead more\nThe Presence of Left Ventricular False Tendons is Not Associated with Increased Arrhythmogenic Risk in Highly Active Subjects.\nPreprint\nFile available\nFebruary 2022\n·\n37\nReads\nDanny AJP van de Sande\n·\nBart van Gorsel\n·\nMaarten J Cramer\n·\n[...]\n·\nRienk Rienks\nBackground Left ventricular false tendons (LVFTs) are common. There is conflicting evidence whether LVFTs have clinically important electrophysiological effects. The aim of this study was to investigate, in a highly active population: 1) the prevalence of LVFTs, 2) the association between LVFTs and abnormalities on the resting 12-lead-electrocardiograms (ECG) and 3) the association of LVFTs with ventricular arrhythmias. Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed using data from military personnel in active service who were referred to the Cardiology Department of the Central Military Hospital in Utrecht, The Netherlands, in 2017. Data of resting 12-lead-electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise testing, the prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and relevant clinical data were obtained from the electronic patient data charts. Results In total, 125 subjects were included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of LVFTs was 40% and the they were predominantly located from the mid-IVS top the apical segment of the LV (type 4). Non-significant T-Wave Abnormalities (NS-TWA) were significantly more prevalent in subjects with LVFTs and were predominantly localized in the lateral leads. There was no increased risk of any arrhythmia. Follow-up data of 3.2 years showed no difference in the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events. Conclusion In this highly active group subjects, the presence of an LVFT did not yield an increased arrhythmogenic risk compared to subjects without a LVFT.\nRead more\nDownload\nDiving with hypertension and antihypertensive drugs\nLiterature Review\nMarch 2020\n·\n141\nReads\n·\n14\nCitations\nPeter E Westerweel\n·\nRienk Rienks\n·\nAhmed Sakr\n·\nAdel Taher\nHypertension is a common condition, which is highly prevalent amongst scuba divers.

Divers have to breathe a gas which is at the same pressure as their surroundings, which can be much greater than on the surface. The ambient pressure underwater increases by 1 standard atmosphere (100 kPa) for every 10 metres (33 ft) of depth. [2]\nThe principal conditions are: decompression illness (which covers decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism ); nitrogen narcosis ; high pressure nervous syndrome ; oxygen toxicity ; and pulmonary barotrauma (burst lung). Although some of these may occur in other settings, they are of particular concern during diving activities. [2]\nThe disorders are caused by breathing gas at the high pressures encountered at depth, and divers will often breathe a gas mixture different from air to mitigate these effects. Nitrox , which contains more oxygen and less nitrogen is commonly used as a breathing gas to reduce the risk of decompression sickness at recreational depths (up to about 40 metres (130 ft)). Helium may be added to reduce the amount of nitrogen and oxygen in the gas mixture when diving deeper, to reduce the effects of narcosis and to avoid the risk of oxygen toxicity. This is complicated at depths beyond about 150 metres (500 ft), because a helium–oxygen mixture ( heliox ) then causes high pressure nervous syndrome. [2] More exotic mixtures such as hydreliox , a hydrogen–helium–oxygen mixture, are used at extreme depths to counteract this. [3]\nDecompression sickness\nedit\nMain article: Decompression sickness\nDecompression sickness (DCS) occurs when gas, which has been breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the body tissues , forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system , paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy , with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers. [4]\nPulmonary barotrauma and arterial gas embolism\nedit\nIf the breathing gas in a diver's lungs cannot freely escape during an ascent, the lungs may be expanded beyond their compliance, and the lung tissues may rupture, causing pulmonary barotrauma (PBT). The gas may then enter the arterial circulation producing arterial gas embolism (AGE), with effects similar to severe decompression sickness . [5] Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms.\nNitrogen narcosis\nedit\nMain article: Nitrogen narcosis\nNitrogen narcosis is caused by the pressure of dissolved gas in the body and produces temporary impairment to the nervous system . This results in alteration to thought processes and a decrease in the diver's ability to make judgements or calculations. It can also decrease motor skills , and worsen performance in tasks requiring manual dexterity . As depth increases, so does the pressure and hence the severity of the narcosis. The effects may vary widely from individual to individual, and from day to day for the same diver. Because of the perception-altering effects of narcosis, a diver may not be aware of the symptoms, but studies have shown that impairment occurs nevertheless. The narcotic effects dissipate without lasting effect as the pressure decreases during ascent. [6]\nHigh-pressure nervous syndrome\nedit\nMain article: High-pressure nervous syndrome\nHelium is the least narcotic of all gases, and divers may use breathing mixtures containing a proportion of helium for dives exceeding about 40 metres (130 ft) deep. In the 1960s it was expected that helium narcosis would begin to become apparent at depths of 300 metres (1,000 ft). However, it was found that different symptoms, such as tremors , occurred at shallower depths around 150 metres (500 ft). This became known as high-pressure nervous syndrome, and its effects are found to result from both the absolute depth and the speed of descent. Although the effects vary from person to person, they are stable and reproducible for the individual. [7] [ medical citation needed ]\nOxygen toxicity\nedit\nMain article: Oxygen toxicity\nAlthough oxygen is essential to life, in concentrations significantly greater than normal it becomes toxic , overcoming the body's natural defences ( antioxidants ), and causing cell death in any part of the body. The lungs and brain are particularly affected by high partial pressures of oxygen, such as are encountered in diving. The body can tolerate partial pressures of oxygen around 0.5 bars (50 kPa; 7.3 psi) indefinitely, and up to 1.4 bars (140 kPa; 20 psi) for many hours, but higher partial pressures rapidly increase the chance of the most dangerous effect of oxygen toxicity , a convulsion resembling an epileptic seizure . [8]\nSusceptibility to oxygen toxicity varies dramatically from person to person, and to a smaller extent from day to day for the same diver. [9] Prior to convulsion, several symptoms may be present – most distinctly that of an aura .\nTreatments\nedit\nTreatment of diving disorders depends on the specific disorder or combination of disorders, but two treatments are commonly associated with first aid and definitive treatment where diving is involved. These are first aid oxygen administration at high concentration, which is seldom contraindicated, and generally recommended as a default option in diving accidents where there is any significant probability of hypoxia , [10] and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is the definitive treatment for most conditions of decompression illness . [11] [12]\nOxygen therapy\nedit\nMain article: Oxygen therapy\nThe administration of oxygen as a medical intervention is common in diving medicine, both for first aid and for longer term treatment. [12] Normobaric oxygen administration at the highest available concentration is frequently used as first aid for any diving injury that may involve inert gas bubble formation in the tissues. There is epidemiological support for its use from a statistical study of cases recorded in a long term database. [13] [14] [15]\nRecompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy\nedit\nMain article: Hyperbaric medicine\nRecompression treatment in a hyperbaric chamber was initially used as a life-saving tool to treat decompression sickness in caisson workers and divers who stayed too long at depth and developed decompression sickness. In the 21st century, it is a highly specialized treatment modality found to be effective for treating many conditions where the administration of oxygen under pressure is beneficial. [16]\nHyperbaric oxygen treatment is generally preferred when effective, as it is usually a more efficient and lower risk method of reducing symptoms of decompression illness, but in some cases recompression to pressures where oxygen toxicity is unacceptable may be required to eliminate the bubbles in the tissues in severe cases of decompression illness. [12]\nAvailability of recompression treatment is limited. Some countries have no facilities at all, and in others which have facilities, such as the US, some hospitals do not make them available for emergency treatment. [17]\nMedical examination for fitness to dive\nedit\nMain article: Fitness to dive\nFitness to dive, (or medical fitness to dive), is the medical and physical suitability of a person to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver that he or she does not suffer from any of the listed disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, to a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a procedural checklist, and a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner.\nThe most important medical examination is the one before starting diving, as the diver can be screened to prevent exposure when a dangerous condition exists. The other important medicals are after some significant illness, where medical intervention is needed there and has to be done by a doctor who is competent in diving medicine, and can not be done by prescriptive rules. [18]\nPsychological factors can affect fitness to dive, particularly where they affect response to emergencies, or risk taking behaviour. The use of medical and recreational drugs, can also influence fitness to dive, both for physiological and behavioural reasons. In some cases prescription drug use may have a net positive effect, when effectively treating an underlying condition, but frequently the side effects of effective medication may have undesirable influences on the fitness of diver, and most cases of recreational drug use result in an impaired fitness to dive, and a significantly increased risk of sub-optimal response to emergencies.\nEducation and registration of practitioners\nedit\nSpecialist training in underwater and hyperbaric medicine is available from several institutions, and registration is possible both with professional associations and governmental registries.\nEducation\nedit\nNOAA/UHMS Physicians Training Course in Diving Medicine\nThis course has been presented since 1977, and has been influenced by internationally accepted training objectives recommended by the Diving Medical Advisory Committee, the European Diving Technology Committee, and the European Committee for Hyperbaric Medicine. The course is designed for qualified medical practitioners, but may be useful to others who work in the field of diving safety and operations. [19] The course is to train physicians to recognize and treat diving medical emergencies. Subject matter includes: [19]\nBasic physics and physiology of the hyperbaric environment:\nthe laws and principles;\nthe differences between hyperbaric and hypobaric pressure;\nhyperbaric gases and their effects under pressure;\nlinks between the physiological effects of the hyperbaric environment and the pathology of the disease\nBasic decompression theory :\nhistorical development to current concepts\nfactors affecting decompression safety including acceptable risks and thermal issues\ndistinguish decompression sickness from barotrauma and arterial gas embolism ;\nDive computer theories and types, and comparison to dive tables\nIntroduction to commercial diving and comparison to recreational and technical diving , including differences in procedures, equipment , and diver categories\nThe clinical application of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and the treatment tables used;\nParticipation in surface-supplied diving operation and hyperbaric chamber operations;\nComponents, types, operational and safety hazards associated with hyperbaric chambers;\nDiving-related conditions resulting from the effects of long-term effects of diving, flying after diving, altitude, thermal conditions, age and gender\nNeurologic assessment on a diver with signs and/or symptoms of DCI\nMedical and fitness standards for diving, including:\ncontraindications for both commercial and recreational divers\ndifferences in medical standards for recreational versus occupational diving communities\nlegal implications for approving and denying fitness to dive in an occupational setting\napproaches for determining the safety of prescription and OTC medications used by divers\nFellowship in Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine\nThe Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) offer 12-month programs in undersea and hyperbaric medicine associated with ACGME or AOA accredited programs in emergency medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, occupational medicine, preventive medicine, or anesthesiology. [20] [21] [22]\nECHM-EDTC Educational and Training Standards for Physicians in Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine\nThe standard drawn up jointly by the European Committee for Hyperbaric Medicine and the European Diving Technical Committee defines job descriptions for several levels of diving and hyperbaric physician: Education and assessment to these standards may be provided by institutions of higher education under the leadership of a Level 3 Hyperbaric Medicine Expert as defined below. Certificates of competence may be issued by a nationally accredited institution or an internationally acknowledged agency, and periodic recertification is required. [1] Level 1. Medical Examiner of Divers (MED) minimum 28 teaching hours.\nThe MED must be competent to perform the assessments of medical fitness to dive of occupational and recreational divers and compressed air workers, except the assessment of medical fitness to resume diving after major decompression incidents.\nLevel 2D. Diving Medicine Physician (DMP) minimum 80 teaching hours.\nA DMP must be competent to perform the initial and all other assessments of medical fitness to dive of working and recreational divers or compressed air workers, and manage diving accidents and advise diving contractors and others on diving medicine and physiology (with the backup of a diving medical expert or consultant).\nA DMP should have knowledge in relevant aspects of occupational health, but is not required to be a certified specialist in occupational medicine.\nA DMP should have certified skills and basic practical experience in assessment of medical fitness to dive, management of diving accidents, safety planning for professional diving operations, advanced life support, acute trauma care and general wound care.\nLevel 2H. Hyperbaric Medicine Physician (HMP) minimum 120 teaching hours\nAn HMP will be responsible for hyperbaric treatment sessions (with the backup of a hyperbaric medicine expert or consultant)\nAn HMP should have appropriate experience in anaesthesia and intensive care in order to manage the HBO patients, but is not required to be a certified specialist in anaesthesia and intensive care.\nAn HMP must be competent to assess and manage clinical patients for hyperbaric oxygen therapy treatment\nLevel 3. Hyperbaric medicine expert or consultant (hyperbaric and diving medicine) is a physician who has been assessed as competent to:\nmanage a hyperbaric facility (HBO centre) or the medical and physiological aspects of complex diving activities.\nmanage research programs on diving medicine.\nsupervise a team of HBO doctors and personnel, health professionals and others.\nteach relevant aspects of hyperbaric medicine and physiology to all members of staff.\nGesellschaft für Tauch- und Überdruckmedizin e. V.\nSociety for Diving and Hyperbaric medicine German standards for education and assessment of diving medical practitioners are similar to the ECHM-EDTC Standards and are controlled by the Gesellschaft für Tauch- und Überdruckmedizin e. V. They include Medical Examiner of Divers, Diving Medicine Physician, Hyperbaric Medicine Physician, Chief Hyperbaric Medicine Physician and Hyperbaric Medicine Consultant. [23]\nSchweizerische Gesellschaft für Unterwasser- und Hyperbarmedizin\nSwiss Society for underwater and hyperbaric medicine . Swiss standards for education and assessment of diving medical practitioners are controlled by the Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Unterwasser- und Hyperbarmedizin . They include Medical Examiner of Divers, Diving Medicine Physician and Hyperbaric Medicine Physician.

Austrian standards for education and assessment of diving medical practitioners are controlled by the Österreichische Gesellschaft für Tauch- und Hyperbarmedizin They include Medical Examiner of Divers, Diving Medicine Physician, Hyperbaric Medicine Physician, Chief Hyperbaric Medicine Physician and Hyperbaric Medicine Consultant. [25]\nRegistration\nedit\nThe American Medical Association recognises the sub-speciality Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine held by someone who is already Board Certified in some other speciality. [26]\nThe South African Department of Employment and Labour registers two levels of Diving Medical Practitioner . Level 1 is qualified to conduct annual examinations and certification of medical fitness to dive, on commercial divers (equivalent to ECHM-EDTC Level 1. Medical Examiner of Divers), and Level 2 is qualified to provide medical advice to a diving contractor and hyperbaric treatment for diving injuries [27] (equivalent to ECHM-EDTC Level 2D Diving Medicine Physician)\nAustralia has a four tier system: In 2007 there was no recognised equivalence with the European standard. [28]\nGPs completing the first tier four- to five-day course on how to examine divers for 'fitness to dive' can then add their names to the SPUMS Diving Doctors List\nGPs completing the second tier two-week diving medicine courses provided by the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Adelaide Hospital, or the two-week course in Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine provided by the ANZ Hyperbaric Medicine Group, qualify to do commercial-diving medicals.\nThe third tier is the SPUMS Diploma in Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine. The candidate must attend a two-week course, write a dissertation related to DHM and have the equivalent of six months' full-time experience working in a hyperbaric medicine unit.\nThe fourth tier is the Certificate in Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine from the ANZ College of Anaesthetists.\nTraining of divers and support staff in relevant first aid\nedit\nDivers\nedit\nA basic knowledge understanding of the causes, symptoms and first aid treatment of diving related disorders is part of the basic training for most recreational and professional divers, both to help the diver avoid the disorders, and to allow appropriate action in case of an incident resulting in injury. [27]\nRecreational divers\nedit\nA recreational diver has the same duty of care to other divers as any ordinary member of the public, and therefore there is no obligation to train recreational divers in first aid or other medical skills. Nevertheless, first aid training is recommended by most, if not all, recreational diver training agencies. [29] [30] [31]\nRecreational diving instructors and divemasters, on the other hand, are to a greater or lesser extent responsible for the safety of divers under their guidance, and therefore are generally required to be trained and certified to some level of rescue and first aid competence, as defined in the relevant training standards of the certifying body. In many cases this includes certification in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and first aid oxygen administration for diving accidents.\nProfessional divers\nedit\nProfessional divers usually operate as members of a team with a duty of care for other members of the team. Divers are expected to act as standby divers for other members of the team and the duties of a standby diver include rescue attempts if the working diver gets into difficulties. Consequently, professional divers are generally required to be trained in rescue procedures appropriate to the modes of diving they are certified in, and to administer first aid in emergencies. The specific training, competence and registration for these skills varies, and may be specified by state or national legislation or by industry codes of practice. [27] [32]\nDiving supervisors have a similar duty of care, and as they are responsible for operational planning and safety, generally are also expected to manage emergency procedures, including the first aid that may be required. The level of first aid training, competence and certification will generally take this into account.\nIn South Africa, registered commercial and scientific divers must hold current certification in first aid at the national Level 1, with additional training in oxygen administration for diving accidents, and registered diving supervisors must hold Level 2 first aid certification. [27]\nOffshore diving contractors frequently follow the IMCA recommendations.\nDiver medic\nedit\nA diver medic or diving medical technician is a member of a dive team who is trained in advanced first aid. [33]\nA diver medic recognised by IMCA must be capable of administering first aid and emergency treatment, and carrying out the directions of a physician, and be familiar with diving procedures and compression chamber operation. The diver medic must also be able to assist the diving supervisor with decompression procedures, and provide treatment in a hyperbaric chamber in an emergency. The diver medic must hold, at a minimum, a valid certificate of medical fitness to operate in a pressurized environment, and a certificate of medical fitness to dive. [34]\nTraining standards for diver medic are described in the IMCA Scheme for Recognition of Diver Medic Training. [34]\nEthical and medicolegal issues\nedit\nExperimental work on human subjects is often ethically and/or legally impracticable. Tests where the endpoint is symptomatic decompression sickness are difficult to authorise and this makes the accumulation of adequate and statistically valid data difficult. The precautionary principle may be applied in the absence of information allowing a realistic assessment of risk. Analysis of investigations into accidents is useful when reliable results are available, which is less often than would be desirable, but privacy concerns prevent a large mount of information potentially useful to the general diving population from being made available to researchers.\nThis section needs expansion .

The online version of this course is self-contained, but also acts as a primer to the full course which is delivered in a classroom.  Here’s my review of that online course.\nThe course was authored and presented by Gareth Lock, a retired RAF Navigator who’s post-military career has encompassed accident analysis and crew operations course design in the oil and gas industry; and currently the Director for Risk Management with GUE.  His Human Factors in Diving course reflects his work on a PhD examining the role of human factors in scuba diving incidents.\nThe online ‘mini’ version of the course uses narrated presentations, practical exercises and case study reviews to deliver insights into how the human factor applies to accident prevention in scuba diving.    Human factors apply to the non-technical, non-equipment failures that can be attributed to many scuba accidents.  In short, the stuff that should be avoidable.  We all make mistake….so how can we reduce our potential for doing that?\nThe main areas covered by the Human Factors in Diving  course are:\nSituational Awareness.  Examining the limitations of human attention and information processing – and how these can be improved.\nDecision Making.  Understanding the human thought process and methods to enable better decision making as a means to prevent scuba diving accidents.\nCommunication.  How barriers to effective communication reduce team function and can lead to diving accidents. Improving diving team communication through assertiveness and effective questioning.\nCooperation.  How team dynamics shape diving safety. The roles and styles of leaders and follower – and how to develop effective diving team function.\nPerformance Shaping Factors. How issues like  stress and fatigue effect personal and team performance in diving and diving emergencies. This includes an examination of stress triggers and how to identify the signs of stress.\nAs a graduate of the RAF College Cranwell (the UK’s center for air force commissioned officer leadership training), I could recognize that Gareth Lock’s training delivery and academic content represented the highest standards of professional and academic education.  As a professional technical diving educator for the last decade, I found the content very interesting, directly relevant and, often, extremely thought provoking.\nThere was a great amount of learning on the Human Factors in Diving course that I now wish to apply as a  technical diving instructor and diver.  The course effectively provokes a diligent self-examination of your own approaches to team diving, communication and situational awareness.  It also provides some very useful methods that can be applied to improve team diving dynamics and progressive improvement.  These same lessons are beneficial from an instructional perspective – as a diving class could (should?) be considered as a functional team; with the instructor in a leadership role.\nThere are many diving instructors who would certainly benefit from this course.  This applies both for their own professional development and also as a means to learn new and effective teaching tools to maximize the learning potential of their classes.  Dive instructors do need to have a reliable state of situational awareness, sound decision making and effective communications.  I learned a lot in this course about how to deliver effective team briefings…. and also how to perform the most beneficial post-dive debriefs and give effective performance feedback.\nThe use of case studies on the course balanced the academic materials and brought lessons clearly into focus .  More than anything else, the case studies validate the ‘human factors’ issues within the accidents and scenarios discussed.  It can be clearly seen how many accidents could be avoided through more effective team procedures, awareness, communication and more effective decision making.\nI would really stress that any diver who operates in high performance teams and/or undertakes a supervisory or educational role in diving would significantly benefit from the training provided by this course.\nWell trained divers all understand how technical or equipment failures can impact on safety and play a role in accidents.  Far too little thought goes into the human factors that heavily influence diving safety – and no training courses really provide sufficient insight into how to improve individual and team performance in those aspects.\n The issue of ‘human error’ within accident cause has already been addressed in many safety critical industries, like aviation, medicine, oil & gas and nuclear energy. It is surprising that nobody in the diving education community has properly addressed these same issues until Gareth wrote the ‘Human Factors’ course. Diving is, after all, a relatively risk prone activity that places a great emphasis on human performance to either prevent, or resolve emergencies.\nAs Gareth says: “ Recent research has shown that 44% of SCUBA diving incidents had complacency as a contributory factor, 39% overconfidence, 36% as error in judgement, 33% poor or failure to communicate…these are not technical failures… “\nThat, to me, seems a very compelling reason to gain a better understanding of how those human factors influence our performance as divers… and, most importantly, can be improved through education and effective behavior adaptation.\n When I first signed up for this course, I had an expectation that I’d whistle through the 3-hour syllabus quite quickly.  I consider myself well educated on leadership, team development and diving performance.  It is, after all, my professional career to  develop safe, confident and competent advanced level divers who can operate effectively in teams under situations of high stress.\nI must admit that the course very quickly broke down those expectations.  I found the materials and presentations fascinating.  Some modules I repeated several times… as they were so thought provoking.  I filled a notepad with ideas and concepts that I wanted to apply in my own team diving and also a plethora of lessons and ideas that I wanted to start introducing on my own technical diving training courses.\nAs a diligent technical diving instructor, one of my biggest challenges has always been in positively shaping student diver mindsets.   In particular, the issues of improving situational awareness, developing effective task prioritization, improving decision making…. and building an effective sense of self-awareness that might help reduce future complacency and corner-cutting.   Gareth’s Human Factors course gave me fresh insights into all of those issues… and a bunch of effective tools to help achieve my goals as a technical diving instructor.\nI also found the course quite enlightening on the issue of stress and performance.  This is not only applicable in respect to diving accidents, but also in regards to maximizing student performance in training.\nTechnical and advanced level diving courses are (should be) very challenging and push students beyond their comfort zones.   Push students too little and they won’t gain the proper benefit of training when it comes to handling future emergencies.  Push students too far and they lose the ability to learn anything more – they may ;switch off’ internally, or even panic.   I’ve never heard this concept discussed on any technical diver, or instructor, course.  However, it was really pleasing to see how Gareth explained that intrinsic link between stress and performance.\nOverall, with a cost of only $99 (£69GBP), the online course represents a very sound training investment.  You’d certainly learn more from this course than if you spend 2-3 times that much on a typical scuba agency ‘specialty’ course.   Most importantly, this course can seriously help shape your understanding and approach to  safer diving as an individual diver, as an instructor or as a technical diving team.\nEven beyond the context of scuba diving, this course has many benefits for those in managerial and supervisory roles within high performance teams.\nI got a lot out of this course… and if I lived closer to the UK, then I’d definitely want to attend the full 2-day classroom based course.  I would suggest that if you consider yourself any sort of “serious” diver, then this course should be a part of your immediate diving education.\n  For more information, or to sign up for the course, please see the Human Factors in Diving website.\nTo attend the full Human Factors in Diving course, check out these international dates:\n[ezcol_1third id=”” class=”” style=””]\n10 & 11 Oct 2016\nLocation: Comfort Inn, Central Birmingham.

The risks of dying during recreational , scientific or commercial diving are small, and on scuba , deaths are usually associated with poor gas management , poor buoyancy control , equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, though the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error on the part of the victim. [1] [2]\nEquipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba , and while the cause of death is commonly recorded as drowning , this is mainly the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events taking place in water. Arterial gas embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, and it, too, is the consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent , possibly aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. [3] There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases, the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research that could improve diver safety. [4]\nFor diving facilities, scuba diving fatalities have a major financial impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs.

This is comparable with jogging (13 deaths per 100,000 persons per year) and motor vehicle accidents (16 deaths per 100,000 persons per year), and within the range where reduction is desirable by Health and Safety Executive (HSE) criteria. [5]\nActivity-based statistics would be a more accurate measurement of risk. Noted above are statistics showing diving fatalities comparable to motor vehicle accidents of 16.4 per 100,000 divers and 16 per 100,000 drivers. DAN 2014/12/17 data shows there are 3.174 million divers in America. Their data shows that 2.351 million dive 1 to 7 times per year. 823,000 dive 8 or more times per year. It is reasonable to say that the average would be in the neighbourhood of 5 dives per year. [6]\nData for 17 million student-diver certifications during 63 million student dives over a 20-year period from 1989-2008 show a mean per capita death rate of 1.7 deaths per 100,000 student divers per year. This was lower than for insured DAN members during 2000–2006 at 16.4 deaths per 100,000 DAN members per year, but fatality rate per dive is a better measure of exposure risk, A mean annual fatality rate of 0.48 deaths per 100,000 student dives per year and 0.54 deaths per 100,000 BSAC dives per year and 1.03 deaths per 100,000 non-BSAC dives per year during 2007. The total size of the diving population is important for determining overall fatality rates, and the population estimates from the 1990s of several million U.S. divers need to be updated. [5]\nDuring 2006 to 2015 there were an estimated 306 million recreational dives made by US residents and 563 recreational diving deaths from this population. The fatality rate was 1.8 per million recreational dives, and 47 deaths for every 1000 emergency department presentations for scuba injuries. [7]\nThe most frequent known root cause for diving fatalities is running out of, or low on, breathing gas, but the reasons for this are not specified, probably due to lack of data. Other factors cited include buoyancy control, entanglement or entrapment, rough water, equipment misuse or problems and emergency ascent . The most common injuries and causes of death were drowning or asphyxia due to inhalation of water, air embolism and cardiac events. Risk of cardiac arrest is greater for older divers, and greater for men than women, although the risks are equal by age 65. [5]\nSeveral plausible opinions have been put forward but have not yet been empirically validated. Suggested contributing factors included inexperience, infrequent diving, inadequate supervision, insufficient predive briefings, buddy separation and dive conditions beyond the diver's training, experience or physical capacity. [5]\nAnnual fatalities\nedit\nThis section needs expansion with: data from other years and other geographical regions. You can help by adding to it . ( October 2023 )\nDAN was notified of 561 recreational scuba deaths during 2010 to 2013. 334 were actively investigated by DAN [8]\nDAN was notified of 146 recreational scuba deaths during 2014. 68 were actively investigated by DAN [9]\nDAN was notified of 127 recreational scuba deaths during 2015. 67 were actively investigated by DAN [10]\nDAN was notified of 169 recreational scuba deaths during 2016. 94 were actively investigated by DAN [11]\nDAN was notified of 228 recreational scuba deaths during 2017. 70 were actively investigated by DAN [12]\nDAN was notified of 189 recreational scuba deaths during 2018. [13]\nCause of death\nedit\nSee also: Investigation of diving accidents § Causes of diving accidents\nAccording to death certificates, over 80% of the deaths were ultimately attributed to drowning, but other factors usually combined to incapacitate the diver in a sequence of events culminating in drowning, which is more a consequence of the medium in which the accidents occurred than the actual accident. Often the drowning obscures the real cause of death . Scuba divers should not drown unless there are other contributory factors as they carry a supply of breathing gas and equipment designed to provide the gas on demand. Drowning occurs as a consequence of preceding problems, such as cardiac disease, pulmonary barotrauma, unmanageable stress , unconsciousness from any cause, water aspiration, trauma , equipment difficulties, environmental hazards, inappropriate response to an emergency or failure to manage the gas supply. [3]\nThe data gathered in relation to the actual causes of death is changing. Although drowning and arterial gas embolisms are cited in the top three causes of diver deaths, stating these as solitary causes does not recognise any pre-existing health issues. Researchers may know the actual causes of death, but the sequence of events that led to the cause of death is often not clear, especially when local officials or pathologists make assumptions. [14]\nIn many diving destinations , resources are not available for comprehensive investigations or complete autopsies , The 2010 DAN Diving Fatalities workshop noted that listing drowning as a cause of death is ineffective in determining what actually occurred in an incident, and that lack of information is the primary reason for personal injury lawsuits filed in the industry. [14]\nA DAN study published in 2008 investigated 947 recreational open-circuit scuba diving deaths from 1992–2003, and where sufficient information was available, classified the incidents in terms of a sequence of trigger, disabling agent, disabling injury and cause of death. Insufficient gas was the most frequent trigger, at 41%, followed by entrapment at 20%, and equipment problems at 15%. The most common identifiable disabling agents were emergency ascents, at 55%, followed by insufficient gas at 27% and buoyancy complications at 13%. The most frequent disabling injuries were asphyxia at 33%, arterial gas embolism at 29% and cardiac incidents at 26%. Cause of death was reported as drowning in 70% of the cases, arterial gas embolism in 14% and cardiac arrest in 13%. The investigator concluded that disabling injuries were more relevant than cause of death, as drowning often occurred as a consequence of a disabling injury. A further analysis linked risk of type of disabling injury with trigger events. Asphyxia followed entrapment (40%), insufficient gas (32%), buoyancy problems (17%), equipment problems (15%), rough water (11%). Arterial gas embolism was associated with emergency ascent (96%), insufficient gas (63%), equipment trouble (17%), entrapment (9%). Cardiac incidents were associated with cardiovascular disease and age over 40 years. Their conclusion was that the most effective way to reduce diving deaths would be by minimising the frequency of adverse events. [4]\nManner of death\nedit\nIf the manner of death is deemed to be accidental (or due to misadventure, where this is applicable), which is usually the case, the incident leading to death is seldom analysed sufficiently to be useful in determining the probable sequence of events, particularly the triggering event, and therefore is not usually useful for improving diver safety. [1] [14]\nThe chain of events leading to diving fatalities is varied in detail, but there are common elements: a triggering event, which leads to a disabling or harmful event and causes a disabling injury, which may itself be fatal or lead to drowning. One or more of the four events may not be unidentifiable. [14]\nDeath usually followed a sequence or combination of events, most of which may have been survivable in isolation. In the more than 940 fatality statistics studied by DAN over ten years, only one-third of the triggers could be identified. The most common of these were: [1] [14]\nInsufficient gas (41%)\nEntrapment (20%)\nEquipment problems (15%)\nDisabling agents were also identified in one-third of the cases. The most common identified were: [1]\nEmergency ascent (55%)\nInsufficient gas (27%)\nBuoyancy trouble (13%)\nDisabling injuries\nedit\nDisabling injuries were identified in nearly two-thirds of the cases. [1] The criteria for identify the disabling injury by forensic judgement are specified. [4]\nAsphyxia (33%), with or without aspiration of water, and no evidence of a previous disabling injury.\nTriggering events associated with asphyxia included: [4]\n(40%) entrapment due to entanglement in kelp , wreckage, mooring lines, fishing lines or nets, and entrapment in confined spaces or under ice\n(32%) insufficient gas, when it was the first identifiable problem, but generally the reason for lack of gas was not determined.\n(15%) problems with equipment included regulator free-flow, unexpectedly high gas consumption, and diver error in the use of the scuba apparatus, buoyancy compensator, weighting system or dry suit.\n(11%) rough water conditions included high sea states, strong currents, and surf conditions at beaches, rocky shores and piers.\nDisabling agents associated with asphyxia cases included: [4]\n(62%) insufficient gas, triggered by entrapment, equipment problems, or high gas consumption due to heavy exercise in rough conditions.\n(17%) buoyancy problems, triggered by over- or under-weighting, lack of inflation gas for the buoyancy compensator, or over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit.\n(13%) emergency ascent, triggered by entrapment or lack of breathing gas, was associated with both asphyxia and lung overpressure injury.\nOther contributing factors were not as clearly connected: Panic was reported in about a fifth of the cases, and may have caused aspiration or accelerated gas consumption. Casualties were diving alone or were separated from their buddies in about 40% of cases with asphyxia, but this was also associated with other disabling injuries.\nArterial gas embolism (29%), with gas detected in cerebral arteries, evidence of lung rupture, and history of an emergency ascent.\nTriggers associated with AGE included: [4]\n(63%) insufficient gas,\n(17%) equipment problems,\n(9%) entanglement or entrapment\nAGE deaths were often associated with panic.\nDisabling agents associated with AGE cases included: [4]\n(96%) emergency ascent. Loss of consciousness was typical, followed by drowning for divers who remained in the water after surfacing.\nCardiac incidents (26%), where chest discomfort was indicated by the diver, distress displayed with no obvious cause, a history of cardiac disease and autopsy evidence.\nThere were few overt triggers or disabling agents identified, but reports suggested that about 60% of the decedents displayed symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain or other distress, and 10% displayed these symptoms before the dive.\nProblems were noticed before entering the water in 24% of these cases, at the bottom in 46% of cases, and after starting the ascent in 20% of cases\nLoss of consciousness could occur at any time.\nAutopsy reports usually showed evidence of significant cardiovascular disease but seldom myocardial damage, which suggests that fatal dysrhythmias or drowning may have occurred before heart muscle injury could develop.\nDisabling cardiac incidents were associated with cardiovascular disease and age greater than 40 years, but no significant association with body mass index. [4]\nTrauma (5%), where a traumatic incident was witnessed or determined by autopsy. The cause of injury is usually obvious, and included incidents of being struck by a watercraft, tumbled over a rocky shoreline by surf, electric shock, and interactions with marine animals. Some could possibly have been avoided by the diver. Traumatic injuries were most commonly associated with rough water conditions and being a frequent diver. [4]\nDecompression sickness (3.5%), based on symptoms, signs and autopsy findings. Triggers for DCS included: [4]\ninsufficient gas, followed by emergency ascent with omitted decompression.\nmultiple repetitive dives with short surface intervals.\ngas lost in a regulator free-flow\nuncontrolled ascent due to dry suit inflator malfunction\ndragged deep by a speared fish\nDCS was associated with deep diving, diving alone, and emergency ascent with omitted decompression\nUnexplained loss of consciousness (2.5%), where the diver was discovered unconscious without obvious cause. [4]\nTriggers may have included deep dives, diabetes and nitrox dives, including a seizure witnessed at a depth where the oxygen partial pressure would have been approximately 1 bar, normally considered safe.\nLoss of consciousness was associated with diabetes, frequent diving, and learner divers.\nInappropriate gas (2%), Breathing gas supply contaminated by toxic levels of carbon monoxide, or selection of gas with excessive or insufficient oxygen content for the depth. [4]\nCNS oxygen toxicity, in some cases associated with medications.\nCarbon monoxide poisoning from contaminated cylinder gas\nHypoxia, from incorrect gas choice and from oxygen content depleted by corrosion in the cylinder\nAssociation and causality\nedit\nThe traditional procedure for developing diving safety recommendations is based on the assumption that associations of circumstances with fatalities are causative. This is reasonable in cases where the cause both precedes the effect and is logically clearly connected, such as where entanglement precedes asphyxia, but in many cases indirect associations are not clearly causative and require further verification. This may not be possible when there is insufficient data. Confident causal inference requires consistent associations that do not conflict with logical medical and engineering reasoning. [4]\nAnalysis of case information for diving fatalities has identified a wide variety of triggers and disabling agents, but has also shown that most fatalities are associated with a small group of these triggers and disabling agents, which suggests that a large reduction in fatalities could be achieved by concentrating on remedying these key factors. Many of these could be improved by training and practice, some by a change of attitude, but some diving fatalities appear to be unavoidable as the risk is inherent in the activity and depends on factors that are not under the control of the diver. [4]\nThe most frequent trigger appears to be insufficient breathing gas. This can obviously be avoided by paying more attention to gas management and having a reliable emergency gas supply available. The next most frequent trigger, entanglement, can largely be avoided by keeping clear of obvious entanglement hazards, and can be mitigated by extrication skills, tools and an adequate gas supply while busy. A competent buddy is clearly of great value in cases where the diver cannot see or reach the snag point. The third ranking trigger was equipment failure, but the variety of failures possible is large, and diving equipment in good condition is generally very reliable. No particular item appears to be obviously less reliable. Good maintenance, testing of function before use, carrying redundant critical equipment and skill at correcting the more critical malfunctions are fairly obvious remedies. [4]\nThe most frequent disabling agent in response to a trigger appears to be emergency ascent. Clearly, avoiding the trigger would eliminate the disabling agent, and this should be the top priority, but the ability to cope effectively with an emergency that does occur would break the sequence of uncontrolled and harmful events, and probably avoid a fatality. A fully independent alternate air source or a fully competent and reliable buddy are the obvious solutions, as more than half of the victims were on their own preceding death. [4]\nInappropriate buoyancy was the most frequently identified adverse event, with negative buoyancy more common than positive buoyancy. On some occasions the buoyancy problem was sudden and control was lost quickly, but on many occasions there was a longer term effect of non-catastrophic but chronic over-weighting which led to overexertion and rapid gas consumption, leaving the diver less capable of coping with the stress of the next problem to occur. Buoyancy issues could be a more important contributing factor than is immediately apparent. [4]\nContributory factors\nedit\nThe \"DAN Annual Diving Report 2016 edition\" lists their Ten Most Wanted Improvements in Scuba as: [9] : 5 \nCorrect weighting\nGreater buoyancy control\nMore attention to gas planning\nBetter ascent rate control\nIncreased use of checklists\nFewer equalizing injuries\nImproved cardiovascular health in divers\nDiving more often (or more pre-trip refresher training)\nGreater attention to diving within limits\nFewer equipment issues / improved maintenance\nDiving techniques, competence, and experience\nedit\nMore than half of diving fatalities may be a consequence of violations of accepted good practice. Divers who died for reasons other than a medical cause were found to be about 7 times more likely to have one or more violations of recommended practice associated with the fatality. [2]\nThe DAN fatalities workshop of 2011 found that there is a real problem that divers do not follow the procedures they have been trained in, and dive significantly beyond their training, experience, and fitness levels, and that this was the basic cause of most accidents. In litigation involving diving accidents, the legal panel reported that 85% to 90% of the cases were attributable to diver error. This is consistent with several scientific studies. Medical issues are a significant part of the problem, and certified divers are responsible for assessing their own fitness and ability to do any particular dive. Experience was also cited as a significant factor, with occasional divers at higher risk than regular divers, and the majority of fatalities had only entry level or slightly higher qualification (\" Advanced open-water diver \" certification is included in this grouping). [1]\nA large percentage (40 to 60%) of deaths in the Edmonds summary were associated with panic, a psychological reaction to stress which is characterized by irrational and unhelpful behaviour, which reduces the chances of survival. Panic typically occurs when a susceptible diver is in a threatening and unfamiliar situation, such as running out of breathing gas, or loss of ability to control depth, and is commonly complicated by inappropriate response to the triggering situation, which generally makes the situation worse. Evidence of panic is derived from behavioural reports from eyewitnesses. [3]\nInadequate gas supply\nedit\nThe ANZ survey found in 56% of fatalities and the DAN survey in 41%, that the diver was either running low or was out of breathing gas . When equipment was tested following death, few victims had an ample gas supply remaining. The surveys indicated that most problems started when the diver became aware of a low on air situation. 8% of the divers died while trying to snorkel on the surface, apparently trying to conserve air. Concern about a shortage of air may affect the diver's ability to cope with a second problem which may develop during the dive, or may cause the diver to surface early and possibly alone in a stressed state of mind, where he is then unable to cope with surface conditions. [3]\nBuoyancy problems\nedit\nIn the ANZ survey, 52% of the fatalities had buoyancy problems. Most of these were due to inadequate buoyancy, but 8% had excessive buoyancy. In the DAN survey buoyancy problems were the most common trigger event leading to death. Buoyancy changes associated with wetsuits were found to be a significant factor. Based on a formula for approximate weight requirement based on wetsuit style and thickness, 40% of the divers who died were found to be grossly over-weighted at the surface. This would have been aggravated by suit compression at depth. [3]\nA correctly weighted diver should be neutrally buoyant at or near the surface with cylinders nearly empty. In this state, descent and ascent are equally easy. This requires the diver to be slightly negative at the start of the dive, due to the weight of the gas in the full cylinders, but this and the buoyancy loss due to suit compression should be easily compensated by partial inflation of the buoyancy compensator. The practice of over-weighting is dangerous at it may overwhelm the capacity of the buoyancy compensator and makes the buoyancy changes with depth more extreme and difficult to correct. A failure of the buoyancy compensator would be exacerbated. This dangerous practice is unfortunately promoted by some instructors as it expedites shallow water training and allows divers to learn to descend without fully learning the appropriate skills. [3] Greater skill is required to dive safely with more weight than is necessary, but no amount of skill can compensate for insufficient weighting during decompression stops. On dives where decompression is planned, competent divers will often carry a bit more weight than strictly necessary to ensure that in a situation where they have lost or used up all their gas and are relying on a supply from a team member, they do not have to struggle to stay down at the correct stop depth. Some divers may be unaware of the need to adjust weight to suit any change in equipment that may affect buoyancy, due to inadequate training. Some dive shops do not provide facilities for the diver to adjust weighting to suit the combined equipment when renting a full set of gear to someone who has not used that combination before, and just add a few weights to ensure the diver can get down at the start of the dive.\nIn a survey on buddy diver fatality it was found that regardless of who was first to be low on air, the over-weighted diver was six times more likely to die. [3]\nIn spite of being heavily reliant on their buoyancy compensators, many divers also misused them. Examples of this include accidental inflation or over-inflation causing rapid uncontrolled ascents, confusion between the inflation and dump valves, and inadequate or slow inflation due to being deep or low on air. The drag caused by a buoyancy compensator inflated to offset the weight belt can contribute to exhaustion in divers attempting to swim to safety on the surface. The American Academy of Underwater Sciences reported in 1989 that half the cases of decompression sickness were related to loss of buoyancy control. [3] When twin-bladder buoyancy compensators are used, confusion as to how much gas is in each bladder can lead to a delay in appropriate response, by which time control of the ascent may have already been lost.\nFailure to ditch weights\nedit\n90% of the fatalities did not ditch their weights. Those on the surface had to swim towards safety carrying several kilograms of unnecessary weight, which made staying at the surface more difficult than it needed to be. In some fatalities the weights had been released but became entangled. In other cases, the belt could not be released because it was worn under other equipment, or the release buckle was inaccessible because a weight had slid over it, or it had rotated to the back of the body. Other fatalities have occurred where release mechanisms have failed. [3]\nBuddy system failures\nedit\nIn spite of the general acceptance, teaching and recommendation of the buddy system by most, if not all diver certification organisations, only 14% of divers who died still had their buddy with them at the time. In a Hawaiian study 19% of the fatalities died with their buddy present. In the ANZ study 33% of the fatalities either dived alone or voluntarily separated from their buddies before the incident, 25% separated after a problem developed and 20% were separated by the problem. In the DAN study, 57% of those who started diving with a buddy were separated at the time of death. [3]\nThe buddy is primarily there to assist when things go wrong to the extent that the diver cannot cope alone, and the absence of a buddy is not in itself a threat to life. Buddy separation cannot be a cause of death, it is simply a failure of an engineering redundancy, leaving the diver without backup in case of specific emergencies, and the appropriate response is to abort the dive, as for any other failure of a singly redundant safety critical item. However, unplanned buddy separation may imply that the missing buddy has already run into trouble beyond their capacity to resolve. A common cause of separation was one diver running low on air and leaving their buddy to continue the dive alone. In some cases more than two divers dived together, without adequate team planning, leading to confusion as to who was responsible for whom. Groups of divers following a dive leader without formal buddy pairing before the dive would be split into pairs to surface by the dive leader as they reached low air status. This would frequently pair the least experienced and competent divers for the ascent including those over-breathing due to anxiety. [3]\nIn others cases, the survivor was leading the victim and not immediately aware of the problem. It is common for the more experienced diver to lead, and also common for the follower not to remain in a position where he can easily be monitored, so the follower may only get intermittent attention and may be inconveniently situated when something goes wrong. By the time the lead diver notices the absence of the buddy it may be too late to assist. [3] Each buddy is responsible for ensuring that the other knows where they are at all times.\nBuddy rescue\nedit\nIn a minority of cases the buddy was present at the time of death. In 1% of cases the buddy died attempting rescue. [3] In at least one case the survivor had to forcibly retrieve their primary demand valve from a buddy who was apparently unwilling or unable to share it after the secondary demand valve was rejected during an assisted ascent. [10]\nBuddy breathing\nedit\n4% of fatalities were associated with failed buddy breathing . [3]\nIn a study of failed buddy breathing conducted by NUADC, more than half were attempted at depths greater than 20 metres. In 29% the victim's mask was displaced, and a lung over-pressure injury occurred in 12.5% of cases. One in 8 victims refused to return the demand valve , however, donating a regulator rarely results in the donor becoming the victim. The use of a secondary ( octopus regulator ) second stage or a completely separate emergency air supply ( bailout cylinder ) would appear to be a safer alternative. [3]\nPhysiological factors\nedit\nA survey of DAN America members during 2000 to 2006 indicated a low incidence of cardiac-related fatalities in divers less than 40 years old. The rates increased until about 50 years old and stabilised for older divers at a relative risk of approximately 13 times greater than for younger divers. Relative risk for older divers was also found to be greater for asphyxia (3.9 times) and arterial gas embolism (2.5 times). Relative risk between males and females reduced from about 6 to 1 at 25 years to even at 65 years. DAN Europe statistics follow a similar trend.\nThe victim had a pre-existing condition which would widely be considered a contraindication to diving in about 25% of fatalities. Some disorders have no demonstrable pathology and are easily overlooked in an investigation, which results in incomplete understanding of the incident. Drowning can obscure some pathologies which may then not show up at autopsy. [3]\nFatigue was a factor in a significant number of cases (28% according to Edmonds). Fatigue is caused by excessive exertion, is aggravated by physical unfitness, and reduces the reserves available for survival. Factors cited as causes of fatigue include excessive drag due to over-weighting, drag due to over-inflation of the BCD, and long surface swims in adverse sea conditions, and it was not restricted to unfit divers. Fatigue was also associated with salt-water aspiration syndrome , cardiac problems and asthma. [3]\nSalt water aspiration was a factor in 37% of cases in the Edmonds summary. This refers to inhalation of a small amount of sea water by the conscious diver, often in the form of spray. Salt water aspiration may be caused by a regulator leak, rough conditions on the surface, or residual water in the regulator after regulator recovery or buddy breathing. Salt water aspiration may cause respiratory distress, fatigue or panic and other complications. [3]\nAutopsy evidence of pulmonary barotrauma was found in 13% of the cases summarised by Edmonds et al. This was sometimes a complicating factor, but at other times the direct cause of death. Factors associated with pulmonary barotrauma include panic, rapid buoyant ascent, asthma and regulator failure. In half of these cases a cause for the barotrauma was identified, but a roughly equal number remain unexplained. [3]\nIn cases where the Edmonds summary found cardiac failure was implicated there was either gross cardiac pathology or a clinical indication of cardiac disease in the autopsy findings. 26% of deaths in the DAN studies were due to cardiac failure. 60% of these victims complained of chest pain, dyspnoea or feeling unwell before or during the dive. Cardiac causes are implicated in about 45% of scuba deaths in divers over 40 years old, and they tend to be relatively experienced divers, frequently with a history of cardiac disease or high blood pressure. The associated triggers include exercise, drugs, hypoxia from salt water aspiration, cardio-pulmonary reflexes, respiratory abnormalities, restrictive dive suits and harness, and cold exposure. [3]\nin at least 9% of fatalities in the ANZ survey cited by Edmonds et al. the diver was asthmatic, and in at least 8% of the cases asthma contributed to the death. In other surveys this correlation is not so clear. Surveys have shown that between 0.5% and 1% of recreational divers are asthmatics. Edmonds considers that the statistics imply that asthma is a significant risk factor and that asthmatics should not be permitted to dive. This opinion was prevalent for a long time, but recent studies by DAN suggest that asthma may be managed successfully in some cases. [ citation needed ] Factors contributing to death in this group include panic, fatigue and salt water aspiration, and the cause of death was usually drowning or pulmonary barotrauma. The diving environment can provoke or aggravate asthma in several ways, such as salt water aspiration, breathing cold dry air, strenuous exertion, hyperventilation. and high work of breathing. [3]\nIn 10% of the cases summarised by Edmonds et al., vomiting initiated or contributed to the accident. It was often caused by sea sickness or salt water aspiration or ingestion, but ear problems and alcohol were also cited as causes. [3]\nNitrogen narcosis was cited as a contributory or triggering factor in 9% of cases reviewed by Edmonds et al., but was never the sole cause of death. [3]\nRespiratory disease was cited as a factor in 7% of cases by Edmonds. Chronic bronchitis, pleural adhesions, chest injury and other respiratory conditions may pre-exist in the diver, and though a small minority of divers have these conditions, the frequency with which they are associated with fatalities suggest they may have been contributory. [3]\nRecreational drugs such as alcohol and cannabis have been implicated in many drownings, and cocaine is associated with sudden death in athletes. Edmonds reported an association between drugs used for treating hypertiension and asthma with sudden death syndrome. [3]\nFew recreational divers die as a consequence of decompression sickness, and it is more likely in technical divers exposed to considerably greater depths, and professional divers, but it is a significant cause of serious disability according to Edmonds. [3]\nEquipment\nedit\nEdmonds et al. (2014) suggest that a significant percentage of deaths are associated with equipment failure (35%) or misuse (35%), while the diving fatalities workshop of 2012 found that equipment failure per se was uncommon. This is not necessarily contradictory, as they include incompetent operation under equipment failure and specify overlap between malfunction and misuse. [3]\nIn 14% of deaths there was a regulator fault reported, and in 1% the regulator was misused. Subsequent testing of the regulators showed that most of the problems were caused by leaks resulting in inhalation of salt water, but in some cases there was excessive breathing resistance following a mechanical dysfunction. In a few cases the regulator failed catastrophically, or the hose burst. The difficulty of breathing from the regulator was often aggravated by other factors such as panic, exhaustion or badly adjusted buoyancy. [3]\nIn 8% of cases the buoyancy compensator malfunctioned. This was usually due to a problem with the inflator mechanism, but in some cases the BCD could not stay inflated. In 6% of the fatalities, the buoyancy compensator was not used competently, usually by overinflation which caused an uncontrolled ascent, or deflating when more buoyancy was required at the surface. [3] Overweighting can also be classified as misuse of equipment.\nEdmonds et al. found that 13% of victims lost one or both fins. This was sometimes due to defective or ill-fitting fins, but in most cases the cause was not apparent. In 12% of deaths there were problems associated with the cylinder, usually from user error, such as use of an underfilled or undersized cylinder, the cylinder becoming unsecured from the harness, and failure to open the cylinder valve. In less than 5% of fatalities, there were problems due to malfunction or misuse of weight belt (excluding overweighting which is not a failure of the equipment), harness, mask, exposure suit, submersible pressure gauges and entanglement in lines deployed by the diver. [3]\nEnvironment\nedit\nEdmonds et al. indicate that 25% of fatal incidents started at the surface, and 50% of the divers died at the surface. In many cases, the divers surfaced because they ran out of breathing air. [3]\nDifficult water conditions were implicated in 36% of fatalities in the Edmonds et al. summary. These included current stronger than the diver could manage, rough water, surf, surge from wave movement, and impaired visibility caused by these conditions. These conditions were frequently encountered when the diver was obliged to surface in an unsuitable place due to earlier problems, and were often exacerbated by overweighting and/or the high drag of an excessively inflated buoyancy compensator, leading to exhaustion or panic which resulted in drowning. [3]\nExcessive depth was considered a factor in 12% of fatalities summarized by Edmonds et al. The fatal dive was often the deepest ever for the victim. Greater depth can expose a diver to factors such as increased air consumption, impaired judgment caused by nitrogen narcosis, colder water, reduced thermal insulation of a compressed wetsuit, reduced visibility and lighting, slower response of buoyancy compensator inflation, increased work of breathing, greater heat loss when using helium mixtures, higher risk of decompression sickness and a necessarily prolonged ascent time. [3]\nOther environmental factors cited as contributory to fatalities include caves, marine animal injury (including shark and other animal bites, and marine stings, difficulties entering and exiting the water, cold, entanglements, entrapment, and night diving. [3]\nAccident investigation\nedit\nMain article: Investigation of diving accidents\nLack of solid information about the underlying causes of diving accidents and fatalities creates uncertainty, and this is the principal factor leading to litigation, higher insurance premiums, massive litigation costs and ultimately the continued loss of life. [1]\n—  David G. Concannon, 2011\nDiving fatality investigations are intended to find the cause of death by identifying factors that caused the fatal incident. Causes of diving accidents are the triggering events that when combined with inadequate response, lead to an adverse consequence which may be classified as a notifiable incident or an accident when injury or death follows. These causes can be categorised as human factors, equipment problems and environmental factors. Equipment problems and environmental factors are also often influenced by human error. [15] Three main areas of investigation are common:\nMedical investigation looks into the diver's health and medical factors that may have led to the cause of death.\nEquipment is investigated to look for issues that may have contributed to a cause of death.\nProcedural investigation considers whether the diver followed appropriate procedures, adequately prepared themselves and their equipment before diving, or went diving in conditions beyond their training and experience level. [1]\nThere is usually some form of investigation following a diving fatality. There may be several investigators representing different parties. Police are likely to look for evidence of homicide, The maritime safety authority will investigate in cases where a death occurs while diving from a vessel. When the fatality involves a person at work, the occupational health and safety authority may investigate, and investigators from the deceased's, insurance company and the dive operator and certification agency's insurance companies are likely to be involved. [16]\nIn most cases, the investigation takes place some time after the event. In cases where death has already occurred, the police may meet the boat, or travel to a shore site. An investigation by someone representing a sector of the diving industry may not take place until weeks or even months after the incident. It depends on how soon the event is reported, how long the paperwork takes, how soon the insurance carrier appoints an investigator and availability of a suitable investigator. No matter how quickly an investigation is launched, in most cases the body will have been recovered and resuscitation attempted, equipment will have been removed and possibly damaged or lost, and the people at the site returned to their homes. The equipment may have been mishandled by authorities who are unfamiliar with the gear and have stored it improperly, compromising the evidence. [16]\nPeople who would be likely to be considered witnesses include: [16]\nAny instructional staff involved if it was a training dive.\nAny crew-members of the boat if the dive was off a boat.\nOther divers who were diving at the site at the time of the incident.\nAny rescue and recovery personnel who may have been involved.\nAny members of a professional dive team if one of their members was involved.\nFatal incidents are less likely to occur during surface-supplied diving operations, even though the diving environment may be more hazardous, as the diver is supported by a diving team and the supervisor is able to monitor and communicate with the diver. The supply of breathing gas is more secure, and it is extremely unusual for the diver's umbilical to be severed, which means that the diver cannot normally get lost underwater.\nEquipment testing\nedit\nEquipment testing is an important part of dive accident and fatality analysis. As stakeholders in the community have different and occasionally conflicting needs when it comes to such testing, tests should be done as soon as possible to avoid degradation of evidence, and the testing should be done by impartial investigators, with all relevant equipment treated as evidence and legally acceptable procedures for controlling custody of the evidence. Currently the procedures for equipment testing after diving accidents are poorly standardized. Important procedural items include when testing should be conducted, who is responsible for the testing, what equipment should be tested and what tests should be done. [17]\nThis requires appropriate training of first responders and law enforcement agencies, availability of testing equipment, development of suitable test protocols, and funding to conduct the testing. Procedures for testing rebreathers differ from those for testing open circuit equipment. [17]\nLife-support equipment is an integral part of diving, and dive equipment is generally robust and reliable, but bad maintenance, design flaws, improper use, or other factors may cause or contribute to an incident. When equipment issues are not contributory to an incident, they should be excluded so that the causative factors may be correctly determined. [17]\nForensic autopsy\nedit\nIf diving fatalities are thoroughly investigated it may be possible to determine a trigger, or root cause, for the accident. Data collection and analysis allows identification of the most common triggers and contributing factors associated with fatal diving incidents. Forensic autopsies go beyond the detailed description of the internal organs and include a thorough external examination looking for injuries, injury patterns, trace evidence and clues to how the body and the environment may have interacted. Diving deaths are relatively uncommon, and may be unfamiliar to the pathologist. [18]\nThe forensic pathologist also needs to understand the limitations of autopsy findings in diving-related deaths and realize that there are common postmortem artifacts that can be misinterpreted, resulting in erroneous conclusions.\n—  James Carruso, Regional Armed Forces Medical Examiner, Navy Recruiting Command 2011\nLegal issues\nedit\nScuba diving fatalities have a major financial impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. [1]\nThe lack of reliable and reasonably complete information about the underlying causes of diving fatalities creates uncertainty. Inaccurate findings following autopsies where the examiner had no experience in diving fatalities and had not followed the relevant protocols are common, and in the majority of cases the primary causative factors are never identified, leading to opportunistic litigation.

The risks of dying during recreational , scientific or commercial diving are small, and on scuba , deaths are usually associated with poor gas management , poor buoyancy control , equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, though the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error on the part of the victim. [1] [2]\nEquipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba , and while the cause of death is commonly recorded as drowning , this is mainly the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events taking place in water. Arterial gas embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, and it, too, is the consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent , possibly aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. [3] There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases, the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research that could improve diver safety. [4]\nFor diving facilities, scuba diving fatalities have a major financial impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs.

This is comparable with jogging (13 deaths per 100,000 persons per year) and motor vehicle accidents (16 deaths per 100,000 persons per year), and within the range where reduction is desirable by Health and Safety Executive (HSE) criteria. [5]\nActivity-based statistics would be a more accurate measurement of risk. Noted above are statistics showing diving fatalities comparable to motor vehicle accidents of 16.4 per 100,000 divers and 16 per 100,000 drivers. DAN 2014/12/17 data shows there are 3.174 million divers in America. Their data shows that 2.351 million dive 1 to 7 times per year. 823,000 dive 8 or more times per year. It is reasonable to say that the average would be in the neighbourhood of 5 dives per year. [6]\nData for 17 million student-diver certifications during 63 million student dives over a 20-year period from 1989-2008 show a mean per capita death rate of 1.7 deaths per 100,000 student divers per year. This was lower than for insured DAN members during 2000–2006 at 16.4 deaths per 100,000 DAN members per year, but fatality rate per dive is a better measure of exposure risk, A mean annual fatality rate of 0.48 deaths per 100,000 student dives per year and 0.54 deaths per 100,000 BSAC dives per year and 1.03 deaths per 100,000 non-BSAC dives per year during 2007. The total size of the diving population is important for determining overall fatality rates, and the population estimates from the 1990s of several million U.S. divers need to be updated. [5]\nDuring 2006 to 2015 there were an estimated 306 million recreational dives made by US residents and 563 recreational diving deaths from this population. The fatality rate was 1.8 per million recreational dives, and 47 deaths for every 1000 emergency department presentations for scuba injuries. [7]\nThe most frequent known root cause for diving fatalities is running out of, or low on, breathing gas, but the reasons for this are not specified, probably due to lack of data. Other factors cited include buoyancy control, entanglement or entrapment, rough water, equipment misuse or problems and emergency ascent . The most common injuries and causes of death were drowning or asphyxia due to inhalation of water, air embolism and cardiac events. Risk of cardiac arrest is greater for older divers, and greater for men than women, although the risks are equal by age 65. [5]\nSeveral plausible opinions have been put forward but have not yet been empirically validated. Suggested contributing factors included inexperience, infrequent diving, inadequate supervision, insufficient predive briefings, buddy separation and dive conditions beyond the diver's training, experience or physical capacity. [5]\nAnnual fatalities\nedit\nThis section needs expansion with: data from other years and other geographical regions. You can help by adding to it . ( October 2023 )\nDAN was notified of 561 recreational scuba deaths during 2010 to 2013. 334 were actively investigated by DAN [8]\nDAN was notified of 146 recreational scuba deaths during 2014. 68 were actively investigated by DAN [9]\nDAN was notified of 127 recreational scuba deaths during 2015. 67 were actively investigated by DAN [10]\nDAN was notified of 169 recreational scuba deaths during 2016. 94 were actively investigated by DAN [11]\nDAN was notified of 228 recreational scuba deaths during 2017. 70 were actively investigated by DAN [12]\nDAN was notified of 189 recreational scuba deaths during 2018. [13]\nCause of death\nedit\nSee also: Investigation of diving accidents § Causes of diving accidents\nAccording to death certificates, over 80% of the deaths were ultimately attributed to drowning, but other factors usually combined to incapacitate the diver in a sequence of events culminating in drowning, which is more a consequence of the medium in which the accidents occurred than the actual accident. Often the drowning obscures the real cause of death . Scuba divers should not drown unless there are other contributory factors as they carry a supply of breathing gas and equipment designed to provide the gas on demand. Drowning occurs as a consequence of preceding problems, such as cardiac disease, pulmonary barotrauma, unmanageable stress , unconsciousness from any cause, water aspiration, trauma , equipment difficulties, environmental hazards, inappropriate response to an emergency or failure to manage the gas supply. [3]\nThe data gathered in relation to the actual causes of death is changing. Although drowning and arterial gas embolisms are cited in the top three causes of diver deaths, stating these as solitary causes does not recognise any pre-existing health issues. Researchers may know the actual causes of death, but the sequence of events that led to the cause of death is often not clear, especially when local officials or pathologists make assumptions. [14]\nIn many diving destinations , resources are not available for comprehensive investigations or complete autopsies , The 2010 DAN Diving Fatalities workshop noted that listing drowning as a cause of death is ineffective in determining what actually occurred in an incident, and that lack of information is the primary reason for personal injury lawsuits filed in the industry. [14]\nA DAN study published in 2008 investigated 947 recreational open-circuit scuba diving deaths from 1992–2003, and where sufficient information was available, classified the incidents in terms of a sequence of trigger, disabling agent, disabling injury and cause of death. Insufficient gas was the most frequent trigger, at 41%, followed by entrapment at 20%, and equipment problems at 15%. The most common identifiable disabling agents were emergency ascents, at 55%, followed by insufficient gas at 27% and buoyancy complications at 13%. The most frequent disabling injuries were asphyxia at 33%, arterial gas embolism at 29% and cardiac incidents at 26%. Cause of death was reported as drowning in 70% of the cases, arterial gas embolism in 14% and cardiac arrest in 13%. The investigator concluded that disabling injuries were more relevant than cause of death, as drowning often occurred as a consequence of a disabling injury. A further analysis linked risk of type of disabling injury with trigger events. Asphyxia followed entrapment (40%), insufficient gas (32%), buoyancy problems (17%), equipment problems (15%), rough water (11%). Arterial gas embolism was associated with emergency ascent (96%), insufficient gas (63%), equipment trouble (17%), entrapment (9%). Cardiac incidents were associated with cardiovascular disease and age over 40 years. Their conclusion was that the most effective way to reduce diving deaths would be by minimising the frequency of adverse events. [4]\nManner of death\nedit\nIf the manner of death is deemed to be accidental (or due to misadventure, where this is applicable), which is usually the case, the incident leading to death is seldom analysed sufficiently to be useful in determining the probable sequence of events, particularly the triggering event, and therefore is not usually useful for improving diver safety. [1] [14]\nThe chain of events leading to diving fatalities is varied in detail, but there are common elements: a triggering event, which leads to a disabling or harmful event and causes a disabling injury, which may itself be fatal or lead to drowning. One or more of the four events may not be unidentifiable. [14]\nDeath usually followed a sequence or combination of events, most of which may have been survivable in isolation. In the more than 940 fatality statistics studied by DAN over ten years, only one-third of the triggers could be identified. The most common of these were: [1] [14]\nInsufficient gas (41%)\nEntrapment (20%)\nEquipment problems (15%)\nDisabling agents were also identified in one-third of the cases. The most common identified were: [1]\nEmergency ascent (55%)\nInsufficient gas (27%)\nBuoyancy trouble (13%)\nDisabling injuries\nedit\nDisabling injuries were identified in nearly two-thirds of the cases. [1] The criteria for identify the disabling injury by forensic judgement are specified. [4]\nAsphyxia (33%), with or without aspiration of water, and no evidence of a previous disabling injury.\nTriggering events associated with asphyxia included: [4]\n(40%) entrapment due to entanglement in kelp , wreckage, mooring lines, fishing lines or nets, and entrapment in confined spaces or under ice\n(32%) insufficient gas, when it was the first identifiable problem, but generally the reason for lack of gas was not determined.\n(15%) problems with equipment included regulator free-flow, unexpectedly high gas consumption, and diver error in the use of the scuba apparatus, buoyancy compensator, weighting system or dry suit.\n(11%) rough water conditions included high sea states, strong currents, and surf conditions at beaches, rocky shores and piers.\nDisabling agents associated with asphyxia cases included: [4]\n(62%) insufficient gas, triggered by entrapment, equipment problems, or high gas consumption due to heavy exercise in rough conditions.\n(17%) buoyancy problems, triggered by over- or under-weighting, lack of inflation gas for the buoyancy compensator, or over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit.\n(13%) emergency ascent, triggered by entrapment or lack of breathing gas, was associated with both asphyxia and lung overpressure injury.\nOther contributing factors were not as clearly connected: Panic was reported in about a fifth of the cases, and may have caused aspiration or accelerated gas consumption. Casualties were diving alone or were separated from their buddies in about 40% of cases with asphyxia, but this was also associated with other disabling injuries.\nArterial gas embolism (29%), with gas detected in cerebral arteries, evidence of lung rupture, and history of an emergency ascent.\nTriggers associated with AGE included: [4]\n(63%) insufficient gas,\n(17%) equipment problems,\n(9%) entanglement or entrapment\nAGE deaths were often associated with panic.\nDisabling agents associated with AGE cases included: [4]\n(96%) emergency ascent. Loss of consciousness was typical, followed by drowning for divers who remained in the water after surfacing.\nCardiac incidents (26%), where chest discomfort was indicated by the diver, distress displayed with no obvious cause, a history of cardiac disease and autopsy evidence.\nThere were few overt triggers or disabling agents identified, but reports suggested that about 60% of the decedents displayed symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain or other distress, and 10% displayed these symptoms before the dive.\nProblems were noticed before entering the water in 24% of these cases, at the bottom in 46% of cases, and after starting the ascent in 20% of cases\nLoss of consciousness could occur at any time.\nAutopsy reports usually showed evidence of significant cardiovascular disease but seldom myocardial damage, which suggests that fatal dysrhythmias or drowning may have occurred before heart muscle injury could develop.\nDisabling cardiac incidents were associated with cardiovascular disease and age greater than 40 years, but no significant association with body mass index. [4]\nTrauma (5%), where a traumatic incident was witnessed or determined by autopsy. The cause of injury is usually obvious, and included incidents of being struck by a watercraft, tumbled over a rocky shoreline by surf, electric shock, and interactions with marine animals. Some could possibly have been avoided by the diver. Traumatic injuries were most commonly associated with rough water conditions and being a frequent diver. [4]\nDecompression sickness (3.5%), based on symptoms, signs and autopsy findings. Triggers for DCS included: [4]\ninsufficient gas, followed by emergency ascent with omitted decompression.\nmultiple repetitive dives with short surface intervals.\ngas lost in a regulator free-flow\nuncontrolled ascent due to dry suit inflator malfunction\ndragged deep by a speared fish\nDCS was associated with deep diving, diving alone, and emergency ascent with omitted decompression\nUnexplained loss of consciousness (2.5%), where the diver was discovered unconscious without obvious cause. [4]\nTriggers may have included deep dives, diabetes and nitrox dives, including a seizure witnessed at a depth where the oxygen partial pressure would have been approximately 1 bar, normally considered safe.\nLoss of consciousness was associated with diabetes, frequent diving, and learner divers.\nInappropriate gas (2%), Breathing gas supply contaminated by toxic levels of carbon monoxide, or selection of gas with excessive or insufficient oxygen content for the depth. [4]\nCNS oxygen toxicity, in some cases associated with medications.\nCarbon monoxide poisoning from contaminated cylinder gas\nHypoxia, from incorrect gas choice and from oxygen content depleted by corrosion in the cylinder\nAssociation and causality\nedit\nThe traditional procedure for developing diving safety recommendations is based on the assumption that associations of circumstances with fatalities are causative. This is reasonable in cases where the cause both precedes the effect and is logically clearly connected, such as where entanglement precedes asphyxia, but in many cases indirect associations are not clearly causative and require further verification. This may not be possible when there is insufficient data. Confident causal inference requires consistent associations that do not conflict with logical medical and engineering reasoning. [4]\nAnalysis of case information for diving fatalities has identified a wide variety of triggers and disabling agents, but has also shown that most fatalities are associated with a small group of these triggers and disabling agents, which suggests that a large reduction in fatalities could be achieved by concentrating on remedying these key factors. Many of these could be improved by training and practice, some by a change of attitude, but some diving fatalities appear to be unavoidable as the risk is inherent in the activity and depends on factors that are not under the control of the diver. [4]\nThe most frequent trigger appears to be insufficient breathing gas. This can obviously be avoided by paying more attention to gas management and having a reliable emergency gas supply available. The next most frequent trigger, entanglement, can largely be avoided by keeping clear of obvious entanglement hazards, and can be mitigated by extrication skills, tools and an adequate gas supply while busy. A competent buddy is clearly of great value in cases where the diver cannot see or reach the snag point. The third ranking trigger was equipment failure, but the variety of failures possible is large, and diving equipment in good condition is generally very reliable. No particular item appears to be obviously less reliable. Good maintenance, testing of function before use, carrying redundant critical equipment and skill at correcting the more critical malfunctions are fairly obvious remedies. [4]\nThe most frequent disabling agent in response to a trigger appears to be emergency ascent. Clearly, avoiding the trigger would eliminate the disabling agent, and this should be the top priority, but the ability to cope effectively with an emergency that does occur would break the sequence of uncontrolled and harmful events, and probably avoid a fatality. A fully independent alternate air source or a fully competent and reliable buddy are the obvious solutions, as more than half of the victims were on their own preceding death. [4]\nInappropriate buoyancy was the most frequently identified adverse event, with negative buoyancy more common than positive buoyancy. On some occasions the buoyancy problem was sudden and control was lost quickly, but on many occasions there was a longer term effect of non-catastrophic but chronic over-weighting which led to overexertion and rapid gas consumption, leaving the diver less capable of coping with the stress of the next problem to occur. Buoyancy issues could be a more important contributing factor than is immediately apparent. [4]\nContributory factors\nedit\nThe \"DAN Annual Diving Report 2016 edition\" lists their Ten Most Wanted Improvements in Scuba as: [9] : 5 \nCorrect weighting\nGreater buoyancy control\nMore attention to gas planning\nBetter ascent rate control\nIncreased use of checklists\nFewer equalizing injuries\nImproved cardiovascular health in divers\nDiving more often (or more pre-trip refresher training)\nGreater attention to diving within limits\nFewer equipment issues / improved maintenance\nDiving techniques, competence, and experience\nedit\nMore than half of diving fatalities may be a consequence of violations of accepted good practice. Divers who died for reasons other than a medical cause were found to be about 7 times more likely to have one or more violations of recommended practice associated with the fatality. [2]\nThe DAN fatalities workshop of 2011 found that there is a real problem that divers do not follow the procedures they have been trained in, and dive significantly beyond their training, experience, and fitness levels, and that this was the basic cause of most accidents. In litigation involving diving accidents, the legal panel reported that 85% to 90% of the cases were attributable to diver error. This is consistent with several scientific studies. Medical issues are a significant part of the problem, and certified divers are responsible for assessing their own fitness and ability to do any particular dive. Experience was also cited as a significant factor, with occasional divers at higher risk than regular divers, and the majority of fatalities had only entry level or slightly higher qualification (\" Advanced open-water diver \" certification is included in this grouping). [1]\nA large percentage (40 to 60%) of deaths in the Edmonds summary were associated with panic, a psychological reaction to stress which is characterized by irrational and unhelpful behaviour, which reduces the chances of survival. Panic typically occurs when a susceptible diver is in a threatening and unfamiliar situation, such as running out of breathing gas, or loss of ability to control depth, and is commonly complicated by inappropriate response to the triggering situation, which generally makes the situation worse. Evidence of panic is derived from behavioural reports from eyewitnesses. [3]\nInadequate gas supply\nedit\nThe ANZ survey found in 56% of fatalities and the DAN survey in 41%, that the diver was either running low or was out of breathing gas . When equipment was tested following death, few victims had an ample gas supply remaining. The surveys indicated that most problems started when the diver became aware of a low on air situation. 8% of the divers died while trying to snorkel on the surface, apparently trying to conserve air. Concern about a shortage of air may affect the diver's ability to cope with a second problem which may develop during the dive, or may cause the diver to surface early and possibly alone in a stressed state of mind, where he is then unable to cope with surface conditions. [3]\nBuoyancy problems\nedit\nIn the ANZ survey, 52% of the fatalities had buoyancy problems. Most of these were due to inadequate buoyancy, but 8% had excessive buoyancy. In the DAN survey buoyancy problems were the most common trigger event leading to death. Buoyancy changes associated with wetsuits were found to be a significant factor. Based on a formula for approximate weight requirement based on wetsuit style and thickness, 40% of the divers who died were found to be grossly over-weighted at the surface. This would have been aggravated by suit compression at depth. [3]\nA correctly weighted diver should be neutrally buoyant at or near the surface with cylinders nearly empty. In this state, descent and ascent are equally easy. This requires the diver to be slightly negative at the start of the dive, due to the weight of the gas in the full cylinders, but this and the buoyancy loss due to suit compression should be easily compensated by partial inflation of the buoyancy compensator. The practice of over-weighting is dangerous at it may overwhelm the capacity of the buoyancy compensator and makes the buoyancy changes with depth more extreme and difficult to correct. A failure of the buoyancy compensator would be exacerbated. This dangerous practice is unfortunately promoted by some instructors as it expedites shallow water training and allows divers to learn to descend without fully learning the appropriate skills. [3] Greater skill is required to dive safely with more weight than is necessary, but no amount of skill can compensate for insufficient weighting during decompression stops. On dives where decompression is planned, competent divers will often carry a bit more weight than strictly necessary to ensure that in a situation where they have lost or used up all their gas and are relying on a supply from a team member, they do not have to struggle to stay down at the correct stop depth. Some divers may be unaware of the need to adjust weight to suit any change in equipment that may affect buoyancy, due to inadequate training. Some dive shops do not provide facilities for the diver to adjust weighting to suit the combined equipment when renting a full set of gear to someone who has not used that combination before, and just add a few weights to ensure the diver can get down at the start of the dive.\nIn a survey on buddy diver fatality it was found that regardless of who was first to be low on air, the over-weighted diver was six times more likely to die. [3]\nIn spite of being heavily reliant on their buoyancy compensators, many divers also misused them. Examples of this include accidental inflation or over-inflation causing rapid uncontrolled ascents, confusion between the inflation and dump valves, and inadequate or slow inflation due to being deep or low on air. The drag caused by a buoyancy compensator inflated to offset the weight belt can contribute to exhaustion in divers attempting to swim to safety on the surface. The American Academy of Underwater Sciences reported in 1989 that half the cases of decompression sickness were related to loss of buoyancy control. [3] When twin-bladder buoyancy compensators are used, confusion as to how much gas is in each bladder can lead to a delay in appropriate response, by which time control of the ascent may have already been lost.\nFailure to ditch weights\nedit\n90% of the fatalities did not ditch their weights. Those on the surface had to swim towards safety carrying several kilograms of unnecessary weight, which made staying at the surface more difficult than it needed to be. In some fatalities the weights had been released but became entangled. In other cases, the belt could not be released because it was worn under other equipment, or the release buckle was inaccessible because a weight had slid over it, or it had rotated to the back of the body. Other fatalities have occurred where release mechanisms have failed. [3]\nBuddy system failures\nedit\nIn spite of the general acceptance, teaching and recommendation of the buddy system by most, if not all diver certification organisations, only 14% of divers who died still had their buddy with them at the time. In a Hawaiian study 19% of the fatalities died with their buddy present. In the ANZ study 33% of the fatalities either dived alone or voluntarily separated from their buddies before the incident, 25% separated after a problem developed and 20% were separated by the problem. In the DAN study, 57% of those who started diving with a buddy were separated at the time of death. [3]\nThe buddy is primarily there to assist when things go wrong to the extent that the diver cannot cope alone, and the absence of a buddy is not in itself a threat to life. Buddy separation cannot be a cause of death, it is simply a failure of an engineering redundancy, leaving the diver without backup in case of specific emergencies, and the appropriate response is to abort the dive, as for any other failure of a singly redundant safety critical item. However, unplanned buddy separation may imply that the missing buddy has already run into trouble beyond their capacity to resolve. A common cause of separation was one diver running low on air and leaving their buddy to continue the dive alone. In some cases more than two divers dived together, without adequate team planning, leading to confusion as to who was responsible for whom. Groups of divers following a dive leader without formal buddy pairing before the dive would be split into pairs to surface by the dive leader as they reached low air status. This would frequently pair the least experienced and competent divers for the ascent including those over-breathing due to anxiety. [3]\nIn others cases, the survivor was leading the victim and not immediately aware of the problem. It is common for the more experienced diver to lead, and also common for the follower not to remain in a position where he can easily be monitored, so the follower may only get intermittent attention and may be inconveniently situated when something goes wrong. By the time the lead diver notices the absence of the buddy it may be too late to assist. [3] Each buddy is responsible for ensuring that the other knows where they are at all times.\nBuddy rescue\nedit\nIn a minority of cases the buddy was present at the time of death. In 1% of cases the buddy died attempting rescue. [3] In at least one case the survivor had to forcibly retrieve their primary demand valve from a buddy who was apparently unwilling or unable to share it after the secondary demand valve was rejected during an assisted ascent. [10]\nBuddy breathing\nedit\n4% of fatalities were associated with failed buddy breathing . [3]\nIn a study of failed buddy breathing conducted by NUADC, more than half were attempted at depths greater than 20 metres. In 29% the victim's mask was displaced, and a lung over-pressure injury occurred in 12.5% of cases. One in 8 victims refused to return the demand valve , however, donating a regulator rarely results in the donor becoming the victim. The use of a secondary ( octopus regulator ) second stage or a completely separate emergency air supply ( bailout cylinder ) would appear to be a safer alternative. [3]\nPhysiological factors\nedit\nA survey of DAN America members during 2000 to 2006 indicated a low incidence of cardiac-related fatalities in divers less than 40 years old. The rates increased until about 50 years old and stabilised for older divers at a relative risk of approximately 13 times greater than for younger divers. Relative risk for older divers was also found to be greater for asphyxia (3.9 times) and arterial gas embolism (2.5 times). Relative risk between males and females reduced from about 6 to 1 at 25 years to even at 65 years. DAN Europe statistics follow a similar trend.\nThe victim had a pre-existing condition which would widely be considered a contraindication to diving in about 25% of fatalities. Some disorders have no demonstrable pathology and are easily overlooked in an investigation, which results in incomplete understanding of the incident. Drowning can obscure some pathologies which may then not show up at autopsy. [3]\nFatigue was a factor in a significant number of cases (28% according to Edmonds). Fatigue is caused by excessive exertion, is aggravated by physical unfitness, and reduces the reserves available for survival. Factors cited as causes of fatigue include excessive drag due to over-weighting, drag due to over-inflation of the BCD, and long surface swims in adverse sea conditions, and it was not restricted to unfit divers. Fatigue was also associated with salt-water aspiration syndrome , cardiac problems and asthma. [3]\nSalt water aspiration was a factor in 37% of cases in the Edmonds summary. This refers to inhalation of a small amount of sea water by the conscious diver, often in the form of spray. Salt water aspiration may be caused by a regulator leak, rough conditions on the surface, or residual water in the regulator after regulator recovery or buddy breathing. Salt water aspiration may cause respiratory distress, fatigue or panic and other complications. [3]\nAutopsy evidence of pulmonary barotrauma was found in 13% of the cases summarised by Edmonds et al. This was sometimes a complicating factor, but at other times the direct cause of death. Factors associated with pulmonary barotrauma include panic, rapid buoyant ascent, asthma and regulator failure. In half of these cases a cause for the barotrauma was identified, but a roughly equal number remain unexplained. [3]\nIn cases where the Edmonds summary found cardiac failure was implicated there was either gross cardiac pathology or a clinical indication of cardiac disease in the autopsy findings. 26% of deaths in the DAN studies were due to cardiac failure. 60% of these victims complained of chest pain, dyspnoea or feeling unwell before or during the dive. Cardiac causes are implicated in about 45% of scuba deaths in divers over 40 years old, and they tend to be relatively experienced divers, frequently with a history of cardiac disease or high blood pressure. The associated triggers include exercise, drugs, hypoxia from salt water aspiration, cardio-pulmonary reflexes, respiratory abnormalities, restrictive dive suits and harness, and cold exposure. [3]\nin at least 9% of fatalities in the ANZ survey cited by Edmonds et al. the diver was asthmatic, and in at least 8% of the cases asthma contributed to the death. In other surveys this correlation is not so clear. Surveys have shown that between 0.5% and 1% of recreational divers are asthmatics. Edmonds considers that the statistics imply that asthma is a significant risk factor and that asthmatics should not be permitted to dive. This opinion was prevalent for a long time, but recent studies by DAN suggest that asthma may be managed successfully in some cases. [ citation needed ] Factors contributing to death in this group include panic, fatigue and salt water aspiration, and the cause of death was usually drowning or pulmonary barotrauma. The diving environment can provoke or aggravate asthma in several ways, such as salt water aspiration, breathing cold dry air, strenuous exertion, hyperventilation. and high work of breathing. [3]\nIn 10% of the cases summarised by Edmonds et al., vomiting initiated or contributed to the accident. It was often caused by sea sickness or salt water aspiration or ingestion, but ear problems and alcohol were also cited as causes. [3]\nNitrogen narcosis was cited as a contributory or triggering factor in 9% of cases reviewed by Edmonds et al., but was never the sole cause of death. [3]\nRespiratory disease was cited as a factor in 7% of cases by Edmonds. Chronic bronchitis, pleural adhesions, chest injury and other respiratory conditions may pre-exist in the diver, and though a small minority of divers have these conditions, the frequency with which they are associated with fatalities suggest they may have been contributory. [3]\nRecreational drugs such as alcohol and cannabis have been implicated in many drownings, and cocaine is associated with sudden death in athletes. Edmonds reported an association between drugs used for treating hypertiension and asthma with sudden death syndrome. [3]\nFew recreational divers die as a consequence of decompression sickness, and it is more likely in technical divers exposed to considerably greater depths, and professional divers, but it is a significant cause of serious disability according to Edmonds. [3]\nEquipment\nedit\nEdmonds et al. (2014) suggest that a significant percentage of deaths are associated with equipment failure (35%) or misuse (35%), while the diving fatalities workshop of 2012 found that equipment failure per se was uncommon. This is not necessarily contradictory, as they include incompetent operation under equipment failure and specify overlap between malfunction and misuse. [3]\nIn 14% of deaths there was a regulator fault reported, and in 1% the regulator was misused. Subsequent testing of the regulators showed that most of the problems were caused by leaks resulting in inhalation of salt water, but in some cases there was excessive breathing resistance following a mechanical dysfunction. In a few cases the regulator failed catastrophically, or the hose burst. The difficulty of breathing from the regulator was often aggravated by other factors such as panic, exhaustion or badly adjusted buoyancy. [3]\nIn 8% of cases the buoyancy compensator malfunctioned. This was usually due to a problem with the inflator mechanism, but in some cases the BCD could not stay inflated. In 6% of the fatalities, the buoyancy compensator was not used competently, usually by overinflation which caused an uncontrolled ascent, or deflating when more buoyancy was required at the surface. [3] Overweighting can also be classified as misuse of equipment.\nEdmonds et al. found that 13% of victims lost one or both fins. This was sometimes due to defective or ill-fitting fins, but in most cases the cause was not apparent. In 12% of deaths there were problems associated with the cylinder, usually from user error, such as use of an underfilled or undersized cylinder, the cylinder becoming unsecured from the harness, and failure to open the cylinder valve. In less than 5% of fatalities, there were problems due to malfunction or misuse of weight belt (excluding overweighting which is not a failure of the equipment), harness, mask, exposure suit, submersible pressure gauges and entanglement in lines deployed by the diver. [3]\nEnvironment\nedit\nEdmonds et al. indicate that 25% of fatal incidents started at the surface, and 50% of the divers died at the surface. In many cases, the divers surfaced because they ran out of breathing air. [3]\nDifficult water conditions were implicated in 36% of fatalities in the Edmonds et al. summary. These included current stronger than the diver could manage, rough water, surf, surge from wave movement, and impaired visibility caused by these conditions. These conditions were frequently encountered when the diver was obliged to surface in an unsuitable place due to earlier problems, and were often exacerbated by overweighting and/or the high drag of an excessively inflated buoyancy compensator, leading to exhaustion or panic which resulted in drowning. [3]\nExcessive depth was considered a factor in 12% of fatalities summarized by Edmonds et al. The fatal dive was often the deepest ever for the victim. Greater depth can expose a diver to factors such as increased air consumption, impaired judgment caused by nitrogen narcosis, colder water, reduced thermal insulation of a compressed wetsuit, reduced visibility and lighting, slower response of buoyancy compensator inflation, increased work of breathing, greater heat loss when using helium mixtures, higher risk of decompression sickness and a necessarily prolonged ascent time. [3]\nOther environmental factors cited as contributory to fatalities include caves, marine animal injury (including shark and other animal bites, and marine stings, difficulties entering and exiting the water, cold, entanglements, entrapment, and night diving. [3]\nAccident investigation\nedit\nMain article: Investigation of diving accidents\nLack of solid information about the underlying causes of diving accidents and fatalities creates uncertainty, and this is the principal factor leading to litigation, higher insurance premiums, massive litigation costs and ultimately the continued loss of life. [1]\n—  David G. Concannon, 2011\nDiving fatality investigations are intended to find the cause of death by identifying factors that caused the fatal incident. Causes of diving accidents are the triggering events that when combined with inadequate response, lead to an adverse consequence which may be classified as a notifiable incident or an accident when injury or death follows. These causes can be categorised as human factors, equipment problems and environmental factors. Equipment problems and environmental factors are also often influenced by human error. [15] Three main areas of investigation are common:\nMedical investigation looks into the diver's health and medical factors that may have led to the cause of death.\nEquipment is investigated to look for issues that may have contributed to a cause of death.\nProcedural investigation considers whether the diver followed appropriate procedures, adequately prepared themselves and their equipment before diving, or went diving in conditions beyond their training and experience level. [1]\nThere is usually some form of investigation following a diving fatality. There may be several investigators representing different parties. Police are likely to look for evidence of homicide, The maritime safety authority will investigate in cases where a death occurs while diving from a vessel. When the fatality involves a person at work, the occupational health and safety authority may investigate, and investigators from the deceased's, insurance company and the dive operator and certification agency's insurance companies are likely to be involved. [16]\nIn most cases, the investigation takes place some time after the event. In cases where death has already occurred, the police may meet the boat, or travel to a shore site. An investigation by someone representing a sector of the diving industry may not take place until weeks or even months after the incident. It depends on how soon the event is reported, how long the paperwork takes, how soon the insurance carrier appoints an investigator and availability of a suitable investigator. No matter how quickly an investigation is launched, in most cases the body will have been recovered and resuscitation attempted, equipment will have been removed and possibly damaged or lost, and the people at the site returned to their homes. The equipment may have been mishandled by authorities who are unfamiliar with the gear and have stored it improperly, compromising the evidence. [16]\nPeople who would be likely to be considered witnesses include: [16]\nAny instructional staff involved if it was a training dive.\nAny crew-members of the boat if the dive was off a boat.\nOther divers who were diving at the site at the time of the incident.\nAny rescue and recovery personnel who may have been involved.\nAny members of a professional dive team if one of their members was involved.\nFatal incidents are less likely to occur during surface-supplied diving operations, even though the diving environment may be more hazardous, as the diver is supported by a diving team and the supervisor is able to monitor and communicate with the diver. The supply of breathing gas is more secure, and it is extremely unusual for the diver's umbilical to be severed, which means that the diver cannot normally get lost underwater.\nEquipment testing\nedit\nEquipment testing is an important part of dive accident and fatality analysis. As stakeholders in the community have different and occasionally conflicting needs when it comes to such testing, tests should be done as soon as possible to avoid degradation of evidence, and the testing should be done by impartial investigators, with all relevant equipment treated as evidence and legally acceptable procedures for controlling custody of the evidence. Currently the procedures for equipment testing after diving accidents are poorly standardized. Important procedural items include when testing should be conducted, who is responsible for the testing, what equipment should be tested and what tests should be done. [17]\nThis requires appropriate training of first responders and law enforcement agencies, availability of testing equipment, development of suitable test protocols, and funding to conduct the testing. Procedures for testing rebreathers differ from those for testing open circuit equipment. [17]\nLife-support equipment is an integral part of diving, and dive equipment is generally robust and reliable, but bad maintenance, design flaws, improper use, or other factors may cause or contribute to an incident. When equipment issues are not contributory to an incident, they should be excluded so that the causative factors may be correctly determined. [17]\nForensic autopsy\nedit\nIf diving fatalities are thoroughly investigated it may be possible to determine a trigger, or root cause, for the accident. Data collection and analysis allows identification of the most common triggers and contributing factors associated with fatal diving incidents. Forensic autopsies go beyond the detailed description of the internal organs and include a thorough external examination looking for injuries, injury patterns, trace evidence and clues to how the body and the environment may have interacted. Diving deaths are relatively uncommon, and may be unfamiliar to the pathologist. [18]\nThe forensic pathologist also needs to understand the limitations of autopsy findings in diving-related deaths and realize that there are common postmortem artifacts that can be misinterpreted, resulting in erroneous conclusions.\n—  James Carruso, Regional Armed Forces Medical Examiner, Navy Recruiting Command 2011\nLegal issues\nedit\nScuba diving fatalities have a major financial impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. [1]\nThe lack of reliable and reasonably complete information about the underlying causes of diving fatalities creates uncertainty. Inaccurate findings following autopsies where the examiner had no experience in diving fatalities and had not followed the relevant protocols are common, and in the majority of cases the primary causative factors are never identified, leading to opportunistic litigation.

Every time we go on diving trips, my girlfriend has to take anti-seasickness pills to avoid vomiting during boat rides.\nThese pills cause drowsiness and I was wondering if it is safe to dive under such conditions?\nMost doctors in clinics tell me that she should avoid heavy work because she is feeling drowsy.\nIs it dangerous to go diving when feeling drowsy? What are other options available to present seasickness?\nAnswer from Diving Doctor (DAN)\nSeasickness is a great menace, especially for scuba divers. Diving demands a clear head and feeling nauseous in the water is distracting and unsettling.\nVomiting causes dehydration, which increases fatigue and the risks for getting decompression illness (DCI).\nVomiting in the water with a regulator in the mouth can result in blockage of the regulator, inhalation of water and anxiety, which can lead to panic.\nIt is advisable not to go diving if suffering seasickness. To avoid seasickness I recommend taking promethazine, a sedating antihistamine, the night before diving. Its anti-nausea effects last longer than the sedative effect.\nOn the morning of diving, I then recommend taking hyoscine an hour before going out on the boat. This is generally well-tolerated but can cause drowsiness, dry mouth and blurred vision.\nIt is important for each diver to trial these medications well before going on a diving trip to ensure that one’s individual reaction is not excessive.\nAny diver using these medications should avoid deeper diving as such medications can enhance the effects of nitrogen narcosis.\nIt is important to be aware of this, and ascend to shallower depths if narcosis becomes apparent.\nDiving Accidents |> Injuries Overview |> Salt Water Aspiration Syndrome |> Drowning |> Hypothermia |> Barotraumas |\nDivers also enjoyed reading about...\nCONTACT | PRIVACY | SITEMAP\n© 2003 - 2024\n",

The purpose of this database is to monitor trends in fatal injuries and identify risk factors associated with fatal diving accidents. This data is then used to inform decisions about how to make diving safer for all.\nIn 1970, John McAniff of the National Underwater Accident Data Center (NUADC) at the University of Rhode Island began collecting information about recreational diving fatalities. DAN joined the collection process in 1989, working with McAniff until his retirement in 1995. DAN has continued to collect information about scuba diving fatalities, especially those involving U.S. and Canadian divers (excluding commercial diving).\nThe process of data collection starts with active monitoring of news media and performing internet searches for publicly available reports on fatal dive injuries. DAN also receives unsolicited reports from divers and dive operators worldwide who witness fatal accidents. After the publicly available data is compiled, DAN researchers obtain further information from next of kin and investigative agencies to create more robust case reports. Each case is reviewed, de-identified and analyzed by a team of researchers and physicians at DAN.\nCompleted and analyzed cases are included in DAN’s Annual Dive Report, which is available online to the public at no cost in the DAN Publication Library .\nParticipate\nIf you witnessed or have information about a diving fatality involving any type of diving, including freediving, please download the Diving Fatality Reporting Form and return your report to\n*protected email*\nor mail it to:\nDAN Research c/o Jeanette Moore 6 West Colony Place Durham, NC 27705\nYou may also report a fatality or request a physical copy of the reporting form via mail, email or phone through the DAN Medical Information Line at +1 (800) 446-2671.\nIf you are requesting information about a fatality, please read our Policy for Release of Medical Information .\nFAQs\nQ: How do I report a fatality to DAN?\nIf you witnessed or have information about a diving fatality, please download or request a physical copy of the Diving Fatality Reporting Form\nand return your report to DAN Research. You can notify DAN about a fatality by: – calling the DAN Medical Information Line at +1 (919) 684-2948, – sending an email to \n*protected email*\n, or – via mail to DAN Research, c/o Jeanette Moore, 6 West Colony Place, Durham, NC 27705\nQ: How can I get a copy of a fatality reporting form?\nCall DAN Research at +1 (919) 684-2948, ext. 1260, or send an email to\n*protected email*\n.\nQ: Where are diving fatalities published?\nDAN publishes an overview and analysis of diving fatalities every year as part of the Annual Diving Report. Multi-year analyses are presented at scientific conferences and dive shows or are published in peer-reviewed journals. A list of publications can be found on this page.\nQ: How can I obtain a copy of the Annual Diving Report?\nCopies of the Annual Diving Report can be downloaded from the  DAN Publication Library at no charge.\nQ: How can I obtain a copy of a fatality report from DAN?\nValid legal authorization is required to obtain records from DAN. In the case of a fatality, a subpoena from North Carolina District 14 or the Middle District of North Carolina is required. If you are the executor of the decedent’s estate, you must show legal proof of this to DAN. Please read DAN’s policy for release of medical information. All legal requests should be submitted to DAN’s Custodian of Records , and all must be approved by the DAN legal counsel.\nAdditional Reading and References\nYou can download the DAN Annual Diving Reports and the Proceedings of the 2010 Recreational Diving Fatalities Workshop and the Diving for Science 2007.

Wearing too much or not enough lead!\nAs a PADI Master Instructor of many years, this is one of the most common misjudgments that I see made regularly by students and ‘especially’ by their instructors. In an attempt to avoid buoyancy problems, divers are often over loaded with far too much lead weight around their waist and inside their BCD (buoyancy control device).\nA common misconception is that if you carry lots of excess weight, then you won’t struggle on the surface and will sink with more ease. Ironically, this is more likely to create buoyancy problems and cause unnecessary struggling and frustration, particularly with ascents and descents.\nThe main problem with being over laden with lead during a dive is that air is usually added to the jacket to keep the diver off the bottom and above the corals, which means that as the diver ascends he needs to compensate for the increased buoyancy by deflating the expanding air.\nIf the diver forgets or does not act soon enough, this could cause an uncontrolled ascent which very often leads to buddy separation.\nAlthough many factors influence how much weight a diver should use, such as the type of equipment being worn and the water salinity content, there is a surface weight check skill that offers a true guide on the correct amount needed to achieve neutral buoyancy underwater.\nIf this weight check is performed at the beginning of a dive then it may be appropriate to add a little extra lead (approx 2kg) to avoid excess buoyancy during your safety stop.\nThis is especially true if you’re using aluminium cylinders which tend to cause additional positive buoyancy when the remaining air inside the tank runs low.\nWhen a diver is correctly weighted for neutral buoyancy, the increased underwater control and comfort has numerous benefits which include conserving energy and air consumption, allowing great underwater photography, offering an enjoyable relaxed diving experience and making an unrestricted safety stop before exiting the water.\nEqualization Techniques\n2. Trying too hard to equalise your ears - or not at all!\nWhen scuba divers descend below the surface they need to equalize their body’s air spaces, in particular the air filled parts of the ears. New divers often have problems mastering equalization techniques and tend to make the mistake of trying too hard and too late.\nThe Valsalva maneuver of the Eustachian tubes is the primary method used to equalize the ears and sinuses when descending, by attempting to exhale through the nose against pinched nostrils.\nHowever, this method should not be overdone forcefully as it can cause damage inside the ears. If the ambient pressure is greater than the pressure inside the middle ear and the diver continues to go down, a rupture of the round window is likely.\nThe process of equalizing should begin at the surface and continued regularly before the pressure increases, especially as you descend through the first 6 meters. This is where the biggest pressure change happens, from low pressure air above sea level to higher pressure under water and can result in a ‘squeeze’.\nIf pain or discomfort is felt during the descent it indicates that the air spaces have not been equalized and the descent should stop. If you then ascend to a point where the discomfort disappears and slowly try again more often, you may find that this will clear the problem.\nOther air spaces that also need equalizing, though from different techniques, include the air inside the mask and the lungs. A mask squeeze (facial barotrauma) can be avoided by gently introducing air into the pocket through the nose, though generally this isn’t always necessary in shallow water.\nThe most important air space to equalize is the air filled lungs by a simple process called – breathing. Lung ruptures can be avoided by continuously breathing and NEVER hold your breath, especially while ascending.\nEqualization techniques tend to become easier if they are used regularly and correctly. If you have repeated equalization problems during descents and ascents, we would recommend that you seek professional advice from a diving instructor and/or medical physician.\nUncontrolled Ascents\n3. Ascending to the surface too quickly!\nThere is a common saying in scuba – you should ascend slower than your slowest bubble. Although this has very little technical application, an ascent that is slower than your bubbles indicates that you’re avoiding a rapid ascent.\nAscending too quickly is a major concern for new divers and one which has serious consequences if it happens. Once a rapid ascent has started, it’s extremely difficult for a novice to control it and/or slow it down.\nShooting to the surface is very often a reaction by beginners to a stressful situation under water or a result of panic. A recommended ascent rate of 18 meters per minute, about one meter every three seconds, should perhaps be considered the maximum and slower is even better.\nProblems arise from two main areas which are grouped by the blanket term of DCI (decompression illness) ;\nA risk of lung over-expansion because a breathhold rapid ascent can cause serious injury and even death if the lungs rupture and force air into the blood stream\nA risk of decompression sickness by ascending too quickly forcing nitrogen out solution from the tissues and forming small bubbles in the body\nAssuming that the fast ascent is not panic induced, the other common reason that new divers surface too quickly is one that puzzles many of them. They often assume that you need to inflate to go up – wrong.\nExcess air inside the buoyancy controller will expand as the pressure decreases at shallower depths, so the correct method is to deflate the BCD and use your fin kicks to slowly ascend. Inflating as you reach the surface will allow you to float effortlessly and relax.\nHarming Marine Life\n4. Harming underwater marine life and damaging scuba equipment!\nThe damage caused by divers to fragile underwater marine life is a contentious issue and although I personally feel that it’s not the most destructive action to our delicate ecosystems, any extra damage is bad for our industry and more importantly, the aquatic environment.\nScuba Instructors and Dive masters have a tough responsibility to emphasize the natural wonders of our marine life, yet at the same time we are constantly trying to protect and conserve what we affectionately call – Our Office.\nDivers need to become comfortable with the scuba gear and the first few dives can be cumbersome and a challenge. It makes sense to conduct these trial dives over an insensitive area such as sand and a safe distance away from the coral reef.\nFins are usually made from plastic and rubber, but an unintentional kick in the wrong direction can immediately destroy many years of coral growth. Dive gauges and hoses can be easily clipped to the scuba unit and should be streamlined to avoid dragging and further damage to regulators.\nRole model, conscientious dive guides will not encourage divers to touch, tease or harass underwater organisms since you may harm them and/or they may harm you.\nAir Consumption and Gauges\n5. Not checking air consumption and dive gauges often enough!\nIt sounds inconceivable that a diver would run out of air without even knowing it, especially since all divers carry dive gauges that inform us of air consumption, depth and general direction. But actually they don’t – we have to monitor them.\nThe pressure gauge does not give you a 15 minute warning that you’re about to run out of air unless you look at it and the standard depth gauge doesn't alert you if you descend below your recommended limit, though I do accept that modern dive computers do have an audible alert system for this situation if it’s set up correctly.\nSo, the important thing for all divers to learn is that most gauges need to be constantly monitored and a good rule of thumb is that even new and modern scuba gear has a plus or minus 5% inaccuracy reading. Dive limits should not be tested unnecessarily but used as absolute parameters.\nExperience Level\n6. Diving beyond your current experience level!\nHaving the necessary skills and experience to make advanced dives takes extra training and practice. Additional care should be taken if you’re tempted to try specialized diving such as at night, on a shipwreck or in a cave without the proper equipment and training.\nThe dangers associated with diving beyond your current experience level (or without professional supervision) are the cause of most severe diving accidents and incidents (including some fatalities).\nHowever, after basic level certification, the advanced and specialty scuba courses are extremely exciting and rewarding but should always be part of sanctioned scuba certification course. Learn About PADI Specialty Courses.\nSick or Unhealthy\n7. Diving when you feel sick or unhealthy!\nDiving is supposed to be ‘fun and safe’ and very few divers are willing to cancel a planned dive because of a minor illness. However the risk of diving while you’re sick or in an unhealthy condition can be very dangerous and even fatal. The most commonly suffered illnesses include diving with a cold and diving whilst still influenced by alcohol.\nHead colds may interfere with your balance and inability to equalize, whereas diving with amounts of alcohol still active inside the body can easily cause dehydration, which happens to be one of the a contributing factors for recorded cases of DCS (decompression sickness).\nI feel it’s also appropriate here to mention a topic that seems to be disregarded by almost every scuba diver that I meet, including professional dive instructors. The truth is “Smoking and Diving is Dangerous”.\nUnfortunately, many of today’s Dive Masters and Instructors (I estimate more than 75%) regularly smoke immediately before and after their dives. I’ve even witnesses an instructor to request a cigarette while he was still in the water waiting for his turn to enter the boat.\nThis poor ‘role model’ behavior does not discourage new divers to abstain from smoking during their diving activities and the increased risks of lung injuries and its associated health problems continue to plague our cherished sport.\nIf you anticipate that there may be days when you’re not quite 100% fit and healthy for diving and you would like to increase the recovery chances from a bad day, I strongly recommend diving insurance for anyone who is concerned about the safety and treatment for diving accidents . Another section explains the importance of scuba diving insurance in more detail.\nWearing Dive Fins\n8. Walking around while wearing scuba fins!\nIt constantly surprises me how many new and experienced divers struggle around a dive boat wearing fins while trying to get to the dive deck.\nIt’s just common sense that diving fins should be applied and worn at the water’s edge, whether that’s a diving boat or the shoreline. If it’s absolutely necessary to walk in dive fins, the best method is to carefully walk backwards to minimize tripping over.\nDive Information\n9. Do you always log your dives?\nAlthough not bothering to log your dives is extremely unlikely to cause an accident, you may find it very useful to record the information from your diving experiences for several important reasons.\nDuring your early training you probably logged each dive to verify that you met the requirements for the course, but as you progress it’s a great way to store memories of your different destinations and certifications.\nWhilst not a life threatening mistake, I feel that it is important enough to mention here. Other common details you can enter in a dive log are;\nThe Date and Dive Site Name\nNumber of Dives Made\nType of Dive e.g. boat, shore, wreck, cave, night\nThe Weather and Sea Conditions\nThe Visibility and Temperature of the Water\nMaximum Depth and Marine Life Seen\nDive Time and Safety Stop Made\nA Record of Diving Skills Performed\nBuddy’s Signature and Comments\nPre-dive Safety Check\n10. Omitting or forgetting to make the pre-dive safety check - BWRAF\nMy Personal Favourite! The previous nine common problems tend to be isolated incidents among new divers, but the pre-dive safety check – Buddy Check – is omitted regularly, yet it’s one of the simplest ways to avoid a potential diving catastrophe.\nFor those who’re not familiar with the PADI Pre Dive Buddy Check , it goes like this - BWRAF;\nBCD – manual and oral inflation and deflation check, low pressure inflator secure, quick dump valves working\nWEIGHTS – securely attached with a right hand release, correct position and how many, belt not twisted\nRELEASES – all securely fastened, tank band, quick release connectors, snap connectors, familiar with their function\nAIR – full tank, regulator valve fully open and one turn bank, breathing properly with air that tastes and smells good\nFINAL CHECK – no twisted hoses and all streamlined, mask, fins, snorkel, BCD inflated ready for entrance\nA simple and effective ' save a dive checklist ' takes less than minute to perform just before entering the water.\nIdeally you would check your own gear and your buddy’s so that you’re also familiar with his equipment configuration should it become necessary to adjust it for him or remove it from him.\nThis safety check is taught in the entry level diver course and is one that forms the foundation of dive safety and problem prevention.\nSafety Tips |> Overview |> Scuba and Swimming Techniques |> Staying Warm Underwater |\nDivers also enjoyed reading about...\nCONTACT | PRIVACY | SITEMAP\n© 2003 - 2024\n"},

It seems like a no-brainer, but several factors can affect consumption rate. Be air aware: Monitor your air supply.\nIncorporate gas supply into your dive planning. You can only stay under as long as you have enough gas remaining for a safe ascent. Don’t forget to save some gas for flotation. Good rules of thumb for turnaround limits are when you have used:\nCheck your gauge regularly.\nBe aware that exertion, like when swimming in strong currents and depth will affect your air consumption.\nAnxiety or stress can also affect air consumption. Try to maintain normal breathing, but if you do feel anxious, keep a closer eye on your gas supplies; it may dwindle more rapidly than usual.\nRunning out of air is an easily avoidable mistake that carries serious repercussions.\nNext: Mistake #7 – Not Taking Personal Responsibility >\nDiseases & Conditions\nDive Medical Reference Books\nHealth & Safety Guidelines\nSmart Guides\n13 Ways to Run Out of Air & How Not To\n7 Mistakes Divers Make & How to Avoid Them\nMistake #1: Neglecting Health and Fitness\nMistake #2: Neglecting Proper Gear Maintenance\nMistake #3: Insufficient Dive Planning\nMistake #4: Lack of Buoyancy Control\nMistake #5: Diving Beyond Your Training\nMistake #6: Running Out of Air\nMistake #7: Not Taking Personal Responsibility\nBeat the Squeeze: Equalize Like a Pro\nKnow Before You Go: How to Plan Your Dive Trip\nQuizzes\nHome\nSite Map\nPolicies\nTerms & Conditions\nAdvertise\nContact Us\n© DAN, Inc.

Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error on the part of the victim. Equipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba.\nAccording to death certificates, over 80% of the deaths were ultimately attributed to drowning, but other factors usually combined to incapacitate the diver in a sequence of events culminating in drowning, which is more a consequence of the medium in which the accidents occurred than the actual accident. Scuba divers should not drown unless there are other contributory factors as they carry a supply of breathing gas and equipment designed to provide the gas on demand. Drowning occurs as a consequence of preceding problems such as unmanageable stress, cardiac disease, pulmonary barotrauma, unconsciousness from any cause, water aspiration, trauma, environmental hazards, equipment difficulties, inappropriate response to an emergency or failure to manage the gas supply. and often obscures the real cause of death. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, and it, too is the consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, possibly aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.\nFatality rates are comparable with jogging (13 deaths per 100,000 persons per year) and are within the range where reduction is desirable by Health and Safety Executive (HSE) criteria, The most frequent root cause for diving fatalities is running out of or low on gas. Other factors cited include buoyancy control, entanglement or entrapment, rough water, equipment misuse or problems and emergency ascent. The most common injuries and causes of death were drowning or asphyxia due to inhalation of water, air embolism and cardiac events. Risk of cardiac arrest is greater for older divers, and greater for men than women, although the risks are equal by age 65.\nSeveral plausible opinions have been put forward but have not yet been empirically validated. Suggested contributing factors included inexperience, infrequent diving, inadequate supervision, insufficient predive briefings, buddy separation and dive conditions beyond the diver’s training, experience or physical capacity.\nDecompression sickness and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving have been associated with specific demographic, environmental, and diving behavioural factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, asthma, body mass index, gender, smoking, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, previous decompression illness, years since certification, number of dives in the previous year, number of consecutive diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, depth of the previous dive, use of nitrox as breathing gas, and use of a dry suit. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, diabetes or smoking. Greater dive depth, previous decompression illness, number of consecutive days diving, and male biological gender were associated with higher risk for decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism. The use of dry suits and nitrox breathing gas, greater frequency of diving in the previous year, greater age, and more years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.\nRisk management has three major aspects besides equipment and training: Risk assessment, emergency planning and insurance cover. The risk assessment for a dive is primarily a planning activity, and may range in formality from a part of the pre-dive buddy check for recreational divers, to a safety file with professional risk assessment and detailed emergency plans for professional diving projects. Some form of pre-dive briefing is customary with organised recreational dives, and this generally includes a recitation by the divemaster of the known and predicted hazards, the risk associated with the significant ones, and the procedures to be followed in case of the reasonably foreseeable emergencies associated with them. Insurance cover for diving accidents may not be included in standard policies. There are a few organisations which focus specifically on diver safety and insurance cover, such as the international Divers Alert Network\nEnvironmental factors The underwater environment is alien to humans. When not actively hostile, it is unforgiving of errors, and some errors can escalate rapidly to a fatal conclusion. Many aspects of the underwater environment are static or predictable, others vary and may not be easily or reliably predictable, and must be managed as found. The reasonably predictable factors can be allowed for in the dive planning. Suitable equipment can be selected, personnel can be trained in its use and support provided to manage the foreseeable contingencies. When conditions are found to be other than predicted, plans may have to be changed. Sometimes conditions are better than expected, but other times they may be worse, and may deteriorate during the course of a dive to the extent that recovery becomes an emergency.\nPredictable/static environmental factors – conditions which should be considered in the dive plan Variable environmental factors – conditions can change during a dive – dive contingency plans should take into account the reasonably foreseeable variations based on forecasts and local knowledge. When there is no reliable local knowledge, a wider range of contingencies should be considered.\nEquipment safety Two basic classes of equipment are used by divers: Equipment necessary to do the planned dive, and equipment required to do the task for which the dive is necessary. Recreational divers may not require equipment for a task, but it is quite common for them to use a camera, and some will survey a dive site, or use a small lift bag to recover an anchor or diving shot. There are no particularly significant risks associated with tools commonly used by recreational divers. Commercial divers usually use tools of some kind while diving, and some of these tools can be very dangerous if used incorrectly, such as high-pressure water-jets, explosive bolts, oxy-arc cutting and welding and heavy lifting equipment and rigging.\nScuba Open circuit scuba is mechanically robust and reliable, but can malfunction when damaged, misused, poorly maintained, or occasionally due to unplanned circumstances. Provision of a completely independent emergency supply capable of providing sufficient breathing gas to allow the diver to surface safely from any point on the planned dive profile reduces the risk of a non-survivable out of gas incident to an extremely low level. This remains valid only as long as the emergency gas supply is within immediate reach of the diver, which is more reliably achieved by the diver carrying a bailout cylinder than by relying on a buddy or standby diver, who may not be where needed in an emergency.\nRebreathers have an intrinsically much higher risk of mechanical failure than open circuit scuba because of their structural and functional complexity, but this can be mitigated by good design which provides redundancy of critical items and by carrying sufficient alternative breathing gas supplies for bailout including any required decompression in case of failure. Designs that minimize risk of human-machine interface errors, and adequate training in procedures that deal with this area may help reduce the fatality rate. Two thirds of fatalities were associated with high risk behaviour of a high risk dive profile.\nSurface-supplied equipment The essential aspect of surface-supplied diving is that breathing gas is supplied from the surface, either from a specialized diving compressor, high-pressure cylinders, or both. In commercial and military surface-supplied diving, a backup source of breathing gas should always be present in case the primary supply fails. The diver may also wear a cylinder called a “bail-out bottle,” which can provide self-contained breathing gas in an emergency. Thus, the surface-supplied diver is much less likely to have an “out-of-air” emergency than a scuba diver as there are normally two alternative air sources available. Surface-supplied diving equipment usually includes communication capability with the surface, which adds to the safety and efficiency of the working diver.\nSurface-supplied equipment is required under the US Navy operational guidance for diving in harsh contaminated environments which was drawn up by the Navy Experimental Diving Unit. Surface-supplied diving equipment is required for a large proportion of the commercial diving operations conducted in many countries, either by direct legislation, or by authorised codes of practice, as in the case of IMCA operations.\nHuman factors Human factors are the physical or cognitive properties of individuals, or social behavior which is specific to humans, and influence functioning of technological systems as well as human-environment equilibria. The safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur. Human error can be defined as an individual’s deviation from acceptable or desirable practice which culminates in undesirable or unexpected results.\nHuman error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time. The consequences of these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause significant harm, but others can have catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. In a high risk environment, as is the case in diving, human error is more likely to have catastrophic consequences. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career. These findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver’s judgment or performance, and may result in an accident. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of dive accidents and fatalities.\nOnly 4.46% of the recreational diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable to a single contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose as a result of a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in commercial scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to eliminate absolutely all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and would bring all diving to a halt.\nHumans function underwater by virtue of technology, as our physiology is poorly adapted to the environment. Human factors are significant in diving because of this harsh and alien environment, and because diver life support systems and other equipment that may be required to perform specific tasks depend on technology that is designed, operated and maintained by humans, and because human factors are cited as significant contributors to diving accidents in most accident investigations\nProfessional diving is a means to accomplish a wide range of activities underwater in a normally inaccessible and potentially hazardous environment. While working underwater, divers are subjected to high levels of physical and psychological stress due to environmental conditions and the limitations of the life support systems, as well as the rigours of the task at hand.\nRecreational, or sport divers, including technical divers, dive for entertainment, and are usually motivated by a desire to explore and witness, though there is no distinct division between the underwater activities of recreational and professional divers. The primary distinction is that legal obligations and protection are significantly different, and this is reflected in organisational structure and procedures.\nRecreational diving has been rated more risky than snow skiing, but less risky than other adventure sports such as rock climbing, bungee jumping, motorcycle racing and sky diving. Improvements in training standards and equipment design and configuration, and increased awareness of the risks of diving, have not eliminated fatal incidents, which occur every year in what is generally a reasonably safe recreational activity.\nBoth categories of diver are usually trained and certified, but recreational diving equipment is typically limited to freediving and scuba, whereas professional divers may be trained to use a greater variety of diving systems, from scuba to surface supplied mixed gas, saturation systems and atmospheric diving suits. A recreational diver may use some ancillary equipment to enhance the diving experience, but the professional will almost always use tools to perform a specific task.\nSince the goal of recreational diving is personal enjoyment, a decision to abort a dive, for whatever reason, normally only affects the diver and his companions. A working diver faced with the same decision, must disappoint a client who needs and expects the diver’s services, often with significant financial consequences. Therefore, the working diver often faces greater pressure to provide the service at the cost of reduced personal safety. An understanding of the human factors associated with diving may help the diving team to strike an appropriate balance between service delivery and safety.\nHuman factors are the influences on human behavior, and the resulting effects of human performance on a process or system. Safety can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur. Human error can be defined as an individual’s deviation from acceptable or desirable practice which culminates in undesirable or unexpected results.\nDiver performance Safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur. Human error can be defined as an individual’s deviation from acceptable or desirable practice which culminates in undesirable or unexpected results. Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time. The consequences of these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause significant harm, but others can have catastrophic consequences. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of dive accidents and fatalities.\nInadequate learning or practice of critical safety skills may result in the inability to deal with minor incidents, which consequently may develop into major incidents.\nOverconfidence can result in diving in conditions beyond the diver’s competence, with high risk of accident due to inability to deal with known environmental hazards.\nInadequate strength or fitness for the conditions can result in inability to compensate for difficult conditions even though the diver may be well versed at the required skills, and could lead to over-exertion, overtiredness, stress injuries or exhaustion. Peer pressure can cause a diver to dive in conditions where they may be unable to deal with reasonably predictable incidents. Diving with an incompetent buddy can result in injury or death while attempting to deal with a problem caused by the buddy. Overweighting can cause difficulty in neutralising and controlling buoyancy, and this can lead to uncontrolled descent, inability to establish neutral buoyancy, inefficient swimming, high gas consumption, poor trim, kicking up silt, difficulty in ascent and inability to control depth accurately for decompression.\nUnderweighting can cause difficulty in neutralising and controlling buoyancy, and consequent inability to achieve neutral buoyancy, particularly at decompression stops.\nDiving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or with a hangover may result in inappropriate or delayed response to contingencies, reduced ability to deal timeously with problems, leading to greater risk of developing into an accident, increased risk of hypothermia and increased risk of decompression sickness.\nUse of inappropriate equipment and/or configuration can lead to a whole range of complications, depending on the details. High task loading due to a combination of these factors can result in a dive that goes well enough until something goes wrong, and the diver’s residual capacity is not enough to cope with the changed circumstances. This can be followed by a cascade of failures, as each problem loads the diver more and triggers the next. In such cases the diver is lucky to survive, even with the assistance of a buddy or team, and there is a significant risk of others becoming part of the accident.\nDive team performance A dive team can vary from a recreational buddy pair to a professional saturation diving team working 24 hours per day with dive and habitat support personnel on a dynamically positioned vessel. The primary purpose of a professional diving team is to improve safety for the working diver by providing backup and support, and to manage the surface equipment required for the operation. A buddy pair is also intended to improve the safety of recreational divers, and in some circumstances succeeds in this aim, depending on the skills, situational awareness and compliance with procedures of the divers. Technical diving teams can vary between the recreational buddy pair at its worst to expedition teams with structure, competence and planning similar to professional teams.\nFor many applications, the minimum personnel requirement for a professional diving operation is a working diver, to do the job, a diver’s tender to assist the diver and manage the umbilical or airline, a standby diver, competent and ready to go to the assistance of the working diver, and a supervisor, to co-ordinate the team, ensure that the plan is acceptably safe in terms of the organisational policies coded of practice and applicable legislation, ensure that the operation follows the plan as far as possible, and to manage any contingencies or emergencies that may come up during the operation. The primary responsibility of the supervisor of a professional diving team is the health and safety of the diving team.\nHazards Divers operate in an environment for which the human body is not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.\nProfessional divers may be exposed to a wider range of hazards, some of which are inherent in the equipment used to reduce the risk of other hazards. Saturation diving is intended to reduce a relatively high risk of decompression sickness, but introduces other health and safety hazards of living at a high ambient pressure for extended periods, and transfer between pressurised spaces. Failure of a saturation system can be catastrophic and fatal to the occupants and bystanders. Such failures are seldom engineering failures, they are more often ergonomic design and operation failures, and usually systems are corrected after analysis of such failures.\nConsequences Diving related medical conditions, are conditions associated with underwater diving, and include both conditions unique to underwater diving, and those that also occur during other activities. This second group further divides into conditions caused by exposure to ambient pressures significantly different from surface atmospheric pressure, and a range of conditions caused by general environment and equipment associated with diving activities.\nDisorders particularly associated with diving include those caused by variations in ambient pressure, such as barotraumas of descent and ascent, decompression sickness and those caused by exposure to elevated ambient pressure, such as some types of gas toxicity. There are also non-dysbaric disorders associated with diving, which include the effects of the aquatic environment, such as drowning, which also are common to other water users, and disorders caused by the equipment or associated factors, such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide poisoning. General environmental conditions can lead to another group of disorders, which include hypothermia and motion sickness, injuries by marine and aquatic organisms, contaminated waters, man-made hazards, and ergonomic problems with equipment. Finally there are pre-existing medical and psychological conditions which increase the risk of being affected by a diving disorder, which may be aggravated by adverse side effects of medications and other drug use.\nTreatment depends on the specific disorder, but often includes oxygen therapy, which is standard first aid for most diving accidents, and is hardly ever contra-indicated for a person medically fit to dive, and hyperbaric therapy is the definitive treatment for decompression sickness. Screening for medical fitness to dive can reduce some of the risk for some of the disorders.\nRisk The labels used to classify dives are not sufficiently precise for analysing risk. Terms like “recreational”, “technical”, “commercial”, “military”, “scientific” and “professional” are used but are not precisely defined, particularly for risk analysis as they do not identify specific contributors to diving risk. Categorisation by depth and obligation for decompression stops are also insufficient to classify risk.\nThe diving mode has a large influence on risk, and choice of diving mode is commonly based on the outcome of a risk assessment for the diving operation.\nHazard Identification and Risk Assessment: HIRA is a procedure applied to a project, and the results would be used to inform the planners on safety related issues such as choosing the appropriate diving mode, selection of equipment and dive team members, specialised training that may be required, and contingency and emergency planning. Job Safety Analysis: A (JSA) is a procedure which helps integrate accepted safety and health principles and practices into a particular task or job operation. In a JSA, each basic step of the analysis is to identify potential hazards and to recommend the safest way to do the job. In professional diving a JSA would be done for the planned task for a specific dive, and the result would be included in the dive briefing.\nRisk management Risk management has three major aspects besides equipment and training: Risk assessment, emergency planning and insurance cover. The risk assessment for a dive is primarily a planning activity, and may range in formality from a part of the pre-dive buddy check for recreational divers, to a safety file with professional risk assessment and detailed emergency plans for professional diving projects. Some form of pre-dive briefing is customary with organised recreational dives, and this generally includes a recitation by the divemaster of the known and predicted hazards, the risk associated with the significant ones, and the procedures to be followed in case of the reasonably foreseeable emergencies associated with them. Insurance cover for diving accidents may not be included in standard policies. There are a few organisations which focus specifically on diver safety and insurance cover, such as the international Divers Alert Network\nSource from Wikipedia\nShare:\nTwitter\nFacebook\nGoogle+\n"},

        "content":"Drowning Facts for Kids\nClear\nSearch\nWeb\nImages\nKimages\nKpedia\nEspañol NEW\nDrowning facts for kids\nKids Encyclopedia Facts\nVasily Perov: The drowned, 1867\nDrowning occurs when a person spends too much time with their nose and mouth submerged in a liquid to the point when they can no longer breathe. Most instances of fatal drowning take place in situations where those present are either unaware of the victim's situation or unable to offer assistance.\nRisk factors for drowning include epilepsy , minimal swim training or a complete lack of training, and, in the case of children, a lack of supervision. Common drowning locations include natural and man-made bodies of water, bathtubs , and swimming pools .\nWhile the word \"drowning\" is commonly associated with fatal results, drowning may be classified into three different types: drowning that results in death, drowning that results in long-lasting health problems, and drowning that results in no health complications. Sometimes the term \"near-drowning\" is used in the latter cases.\nSteps to prevent drowning include teaching children and adults to swim and to recognise unsafe water conditions, never swimming alone, use of personal flotation devices on boats and when swimming in unfavourable conditions, limiting or removing access to water (such as with fencing of swimming pools), and exercising appropriate supervision. Treatment of victims who are not breathing should begin with opening the airway and providing five breaths of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is recommended for those who have been underwater for less than an hour and whose heart has stopped beating .\nAfter successful resuscitation , drowning victims may experience breathing problems, vomiting , confusion, or unconsciousness . Occasionally, victims may not begin experiencing these symptoms until several hours after they are rescued. Inhaled fluid can act as an irritant inside the lungs . Even small quantities can cause the extrusion of liquid into the lungs ( pulmonary edema ) over the following hours; this reduces the ability to exchange the air and can lead to a person \"drowning in their own body fluid.\" Vomit and certain poisonous vapors or gases (as in chemical warfare ) can have a similar effect. The reaction can take place up to 72 hours after the initial incident and may lead to a serious injury or death.\nIn many countries, drowning is one of the biggest causes of death for children under 14 years old.\nApproximately 90% of drownings take place in freshwater (rivers, lakes, and a relatively small number of swimming pools ); the remaining 10% take place in seawater . Drownings in other fluids are rare and often related to industrial accidents. In New Zealand's early colonial history, so many settlers died while trying to cross the rivers that drowning was called \"the New Zealand death.\"\nContents\nPrevention\nTime limits\nManagement\nRescue\nFirst aid\nMedical care\nImages for kids\nSee also\nPrevention\nThis 1825 newspaper article explains how keeping one's limbs beneath the water's surface provides buoyancy , enabling the head to stay above water. Treading water is described in simple terms.\nDrowning prevention campaign in Ghana .\nIt is estimated that more than 85% of drownings could be prevented by supervision, training in water skills, technology, and public education.\nSurveillance: Watching the swimmers is a basic task, because drownings can be silent and unnoticed: a person drowning may not always be able to attract attention, often because they have become unconscious. Surveillance of children is important. The highest rates of drowning globally are among children under five, and young children should be supervised, regardless of whether they can already swim. The danger increases when they are alone. A baby can drown in the bathtub, in the toilet, and even in a small bucket filled with less than an inch of water. It only takes around 2 minutes underwater for an adult to lose consciousness, and only between 30 seconds and 2 minutes for a small child to die. Choosing supervised swimming places is safer. Many pools and bathing areas either have lifeguards or a pool safety camera system for local or remote monitoring, and some have computer-aided drowning detection. Bystanders are also important in detection of drownings and in notifying them (personally or by phone, alarm, etc.) to lifeguards, who may be unaware if distracted or busy. Evidence shows that alarms in pools are poor for any utility. The World Health Organization recommends analyzing when the most crowded hours in the swimming zones are, and to increase the number of lifeguards at those moments.\nLearning to swim: Being able to swim is one of the best defenses against drowning. It is recommended that children learn to swim in a safe and supervised environment when they are between 1 and 4 years old. Learning to swim is also possible in adults by using the same methods as children. It's still possible to drown even after learning to swim (because of the state of the water and other circumstances), so it's recommended to choose swimming places that are safe and kept under surveillance.\nAdditional education: The WHO recommends training the general public in first-aid for the drowned, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and to behave safely when in the water. It is recommended to teach those who cannot swim to keep themselves away from deep waters.\nPool fencing: Every private and public swimming pool should be fenced and enclosed on every side, so no person can access the water unsupervised. The \"Raffarin law\", applied in France in 2003, forced the fencing of pools.\nDrain hole in a pool.\nPool drains: Swimming pools often have drainage systems to cycle the water. Drains without covers can injure swimmers by trapping hair or other parts of the body, leading to immobilization and drowning. Drains should not suction too strongly. It is recommended for a pool to have many small drainage holes instead of a single large one. Periodic revisions are required to certify that the system is working well.\nCaution with certain conditions: Some conditions require one to be cautious when near water. For example, epilepsy and other seizure disorders may increase the possibility of drowning during a convulsion, making it more dangerous to swim, dive, and bathe. It is recommended that people with these conditions take showers rather than baths and are taught about the dangers of drowning.\nLifejacket (model without rear part). To jump with it into the water, fasten the strap around the body and grab the front neck area with both hands.\nLifejacket use : Children that cannot swim and other people at risk of drowning should wear a fastened and well-fitting lifejacket when near or in the water. Other flotation devices (inflatable inner tubes, water wings, foam tubes, etc.) may be useful, although they are usually considered toys. Other flotation instruments are considered safe, like the professional circle-shaped lifebuoy ( hoop-buoy, ring-buoy, life-ring, life-donut, lifesaver, or life preserver ), which is designed to be thrown, and some other professional variants that are used by lifeguards in their rescues.\nDepth awareness : Diving accidents in pools can cause serious injury. Up to 21% of shallow-water diving accidents can cause spinal injury, occasionally leading to death. Between 1.2% and 22% of all spinal injuries are from diving accidents. If the person does not die, the injury could cause permanent paralysis.\nAvoid dangerous waters: Avoid swimming in waters that are too turbulent, where waves are large, with dangerous animals, or are too cold. Also avoid dragging currents, which are currents that are turbulent, foamy, and that can drag people or debris. If caught by one of these currents, swim out from it (it is possible to move out gradually, in a diagonal direction until you arrive at the shore).\nHoop-buoy in a boat.\nNavigating safely: Many people who die by drowning die in navigation accidents. Safe navigation practices include being informed of the state of the sea and equipping the boat with regulatory instruments to keep people afloat. These instruments are lifejackets (see 'lifejacket use' above) and professional lifebuoys with the shape of a circle ( ring-buoy, hoop-buoy, life-ring, life-donut, lifesaver, or life preserver ).\nUse the \"buddy system\" : Don't swim alone, but with another person who can help in case of a problem.\nRescue robots and drones : Nowadays, there exist some remote-controlled modern devices that can accomplish a water rescue. Floating rescue robots can move across the water, allowing the victim to hold on to the drone and be moved out of the water. Flying drones are very fast and can drop life jackets from air, and may help to locate the victim’s position.\nFollow the rules: Many people who drown fail follow the safety guidelines of the area. It is important to pay attention to the signage that indicates whether swimming is allowed or if a lifeguard is on duty. (lifeguards, coastguards, etc.)\nTime limits\nFor more details, see Drowning#Pathophysiology\nThe time a person can safely stay underwater depends on many factors, including energy consumption, number of prior breaths, physical condition, and age. An average person can last between one and three minutes before falling unconscious and around ten minutes before dying.\nManagement\nRescue\nAdvice given to would-be rescuers of a drowning victim\nWhen a person is drowning or a swimmer becomes missing, a fast water rescue may become necessary to take that person out of the water as soon as possible. Drowning is not necessarily violent or loud, with splashing and cries; it can be silent.\nRescuers should avoid endangering themselves unnecessarily; whenever it is possible, they should assist from a safe ground position, such as a boat, a pier, or any patch of land near the victim. The fastest way to assist is to throw a buoyant object (such as a lifebuoy). It is very important to avoid aiming directly at the victim, since even the lightest lifebuoys weight over 2 kilograms, and can stun, injure or even render a person unconscious if they impact on the head. Alternatively, one could try to pull the victim out of the water by holding out an object to grasp. Some examples include: ropes, oars, poles, one's own arm, a hand, etc. This carries the risk of the rescuer being pulled into the water by the victim, so the rescuer must take a firm stand, lying down, as well as securing to some stable point. Alternatively, there are modern flying drones that drop life jackets.\nBystanders should immediately call for help. A lifeguard should be called, if present. If not, emergency medical services and paramedics should be contacted as soon as possible. Less than 6% of people rescued by lifeguards need medical attention, and only 0.5% need CPR. The statistics worsen when rescues are made by bystanders.\nWater rescue (simulation). The rescuer has already controlled the position of an anxious victim and then begins the towing to shore choosing a backstroke style. The victim's nose and mouth are kept above the water.\nIf lifeguards or paramedics are unable to be called, bystanders must rescue the drowning person. Alternatively, there are small floating robots that can reach the victim, as human rescue carries a risk for the rescuer, who could be drowned. Death of the would-be rescuer can happen because of the water conditions, the instinctive drowning response of the victim, the physical effort, and other problems.\nAfter reaching the victim, first contact made by the rescuer is important. A drowning person in distress is likely to cling to the rescuer in an attempt to stay above the water surface, which could submerge the rescuer in the process. To avoid this, it is recommended that the rescuer approaches the panicking person with a buoyant object or extending a hand, so the victim has something to grasp. It can even be appropriate to approach from behind, taking one of the victim's arms, and pressing it against the victim's back to restrict unnecessary movement. Communication is also important.\nIf the victim clings to the rescuer and the rescuer cannot control the situation, a possibility is to dive underwater (as drowning people tend to move in the opposite direction, seeking the water surface) and consider a different approach to help the drowning victim. It is possible that the victim has already sunk beneath the water surface. If this has happened, the rescue requires caution, as the victim could be conscious and cling to the rescuer underwater. The rescuer must bring the victim to the surface by grabbing either (or both) of the victim's arms and swimming upward, which may entice the victim to travel in the same direction, thus making the task easier, especially in the case of an unconscious victim. Should the victim be located in deeper waters (or simply complicates matters too much) the rescuer should dive, take the victim from behind, and ascend vertically to the water surface holding the victim.\nFinally, the victim must be taken out of the water, which is achieved by a towing maneuver. This is done by placing the victim body in a face-up horizontal position, passing one hand under the victim's armpit to then grab the jaw with it, and towing by swimming backwards. The victim's mouth and nose must be kept above the water surface.\nIf the person is cooperative, the towing may be done in a similar fashion with the hands going under the victim's armpits. Other styles of towing are possible, but all of them keeping the victim's mouth and nose above the water.\nUnconscious people may be pulled in an easier way: pulling on a wrist or on the shirt while they are in a face-up horizontal position. Victims with suspected spinal injuries can require a more specific grip and special care, and a backboard (spinal board) may be needed for their rescue.\nFor unconscious people, an in-water resuscitation could increase the chances of survival by a factor of about three, but this procedure requires both medical and swimming skills, and it becomes impractical to send anyone besides the rescuer to execute that task. Chest compressions require a suitable platform, so an in-water assessment of circulation is pointless. If the person does not respond after a few breaths, cardiac arrest may be assumed, and getting them out of the water becomes a priority.\nFirst aid\nSee also: Expired air resuscitation, Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, Basic life support, and First aid\nThe checks for responsiveness and breathing are carried out with the person horizontally supine. If unconscious but breathing, the recovery position is appropriate. If not breathing, rescue ventilation is necessary. Drowning can produce a gasping pattern of apnea while the heart is still beating, and ventilation alone may be sufficient. The airway-breathing-circulation (ABC) sequence should be followed, rather than starting with compressions as is typical in cardiac arrest, because the basic problem is lack of oxygen. If the victim is not a baby, it is recommended to start with 5 normal rescue breaths, as the initial ventilation may be difficult because of water in the airways, which can interfere with effective alveolar inflation. Thereafter, a continual sequence of 2 rescue breaths and 30 chest compressions is applied. This alternation is repeated until vital signs are re-established, the rescuers are unable to continue, or advanced life support is available.\nChest compressions\nFor babies (very small sized infants), the procedure is slightly modified. In each sequence of rescue breaths (the 5 initial breaths, and the further series of 2 breaths), the rescuer's mouth covers the baby's mouth and nose simultaneously (because a baby's face is too small). Besides, the intercalated series of 30 chest compressions are applied by pressing with only two fingers (due to the body of the baby being more fragile) on the chest bone (approximately on the lower part).\nMethods to expel water from the airway such as abdominal thrusts, Heimlich maneuver or positioning the head downwards should be avoided, due to there being no obstruction by solids, and they delay the start of ventilation and increase the risk of vomiting.The risk of death is increased, as the aspiration of stomach contents is a common complication of resuscitation efforts.\nTreatment for hypothermia may also be necessary. However, in those who are unconscious, it is recommended their temperature not be increased above 34 degrees C. Because of the diving reflex, people submerged in cold water and apparently drowned may revive after a long period of immersion. Rescuers retrieving a child from water significantly below body temperature should attempt resuscitation even after protracted immersion.\nMedical care\nPeople with a near-drowning experience who have normal oxygen levels and no respiratory symptoms should be observed in a hospital environment for a period of time to ensure there are no delayed complications. The target of ventilation is to achieve 92% to 96% arterial saturation and adequate chest rise. Positive end-expiratory pressure will improve oxygenation. Drug administration via peripheral veins is preferred over endotracheal administration. Hypotension remaining after oxygenation may be treated by rapid crystalloid infusion . Cardiac arrest in drowning usually presents as asystole or pulseless electrical activity. Ventricular fibrillation is more likely to be associated with complications of pre-existing coronary artery disease, severe hypothermia, or the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine.\nWhile surfactant may be used, no high-quality evidence exist that looks at this practice. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be used in those who cannot be oxygenated otherwise. Steroids are not recommended.\nImages for kids\nDrain hole in a pool.\nLifejacket (model without rear part).

The medical literature that has become available takes a more rational approach. In other words, each individual should be medically evaluated on a case by case basis.\nNevertheless, there are two important factors that must be taken into account, namely:\nWhy is the individual dependent on a cardiac pacemaker device?\nIs the pacemaker rated to perform at depths (pressures) that make it compatible with recreational scuba diving . It's also important to add a margin of safety.\nAs with any medical device, and most medications, the underlying problem is likely to determine someone's fitness to participate in scuba diving. Thus, the same medical guidelines exist after a scuba diver has a cardiac pacemaker implanted.\nPro Tip : For the most part, the insertion of a permanent pacemaker will indicate some kind of serious disturbance in the actual conduction system of the heart.\nAssessing Cardiovascular Fitness to Dive\nSo, what if the damage has caused a problem with the heart muscle? In fact, this is often the case if a scuba diver suffers a severe heart attack .\nIf this is the case, the individual may lack sufficient cardiovascular fitness (e.g. 7 METs activity) needed to perform basic tasks in the water.\nHere's the thing :\nSome divers will be dependent on a cardiac pacemaker because of an identified rhythm disturbance or some kind of chronic abnormality in the conduction system.\nThis will affect the area of the heart that generates electrical impulses. Hence, there may be some disturbance to the mechanical contraction that shifts the blood. The result may be inconsistent or inadequate function.\nPlus, the circuitry that conducts the heartbeat may also be faulty. The most likely outcome would be improper or irregular conducted signals.\nFor these reasons, without the medical assistance of an artificial cardiac pacemaker, a person may suffer syncopal episodes (fainting or passing out).\nDAN Advice : After addressing all cardiovascular issues, and confirming that the pacemaker can detect arrhythmia and is rated to at least six (6) atmospheres, a diver who can exercise to a minimum of 7 km/h on a treadmill may be able to go scuba diving after a pacemaker implant.\nRelated Information and Help Guides\nHealth and Safety Guidelines for Scuba Diving with a Pacemaker\nAutomated External Defibrillator AED Certification\nCan Scuba Diving Cause Heart Attack - and Why?\nEFR™ CPR and Emergency First Aid Course Requirements\nHow to Efficiently Provide Oxygen to a Breathing, Injured Diver?\nHow Many People Die from Scuba Diving Accidents?\nImportant : The tutorial video [2:57 seconds] presented by DAN explains simplified answers to the FAQ about scuba diving with a pacemaker.\nDivers also enjoyed reading about...\nCONTACT | PRIVACY | SITEMAP\n© 2003 - 2024\n",

But today, \"the bends\" describes a scuba diving condition known as decompression sickness (DCS).\nDecompression sickness is one of the common diving injuries and results from a failure to decompress adequately after prolonged exposure to increased pressure (e.g. scuba diving).\nWhat Exactly is The Bends Diving Hazard?\nUntil quite recently, little was known about the causes and treatments of the bends underwater diving hazards and decompression diving.\nThe bends occur when dissolved gases (usually nitrogen) come out of solution following over-exposure to underwater pressure and the diver makes a speedy ascent to sea level.\nOr put another way, rapid depressurisation allows the inert gas to form tiny bubbles which can travel through the body.\nGas bubbles \"migrate\" through the bloodstream producing disease-like symptoms, especially skin rash, joint pain, and paralysis.\nPro Tip : Even though scuba diving accidents are not a common occurrence, all divers should know how to handle suspected cases of decompression illness (DCI). In fact, any severe attack of the bends diving disease can lead to death.\nSigns and Symptoms of DCS\nDecompression sickness symptoms may occur immediately after surfacing or they can take up to twenty four (24) hours to show up.\nIn general, a diver with suspected DCS will experience some symptoms between fifteen (15) minutes and twelve (12) hours after diving. Typical DCS manifestations include:\nBlotchy skin rash (sometimes itchy)\nUnusual or excessive fatigue\nPain in the joints and muscles (e.g. arms, legs, torso)\nTingling\nNumbness\nTinnitus (ringing in the ears)\nParalysis\nDyspnea (shortness of breath)\nDifficulty urinating\nConfusion (often with personality changes)\nStaggering\nDizziness (e.g. vertigo)\nCoughing up bloody, frothy sputum\nUnconsciousness (including death)\nImportant : You should provide emergency oxygen for any diver with a suspected case of DCS (without delay) and contact DAN or the nearest medical services (EMS).\nDiving Techniques to Prevent The Bends\nThe best way to avoid getting the bends diving disease is to dive within the accepted no-decompression exposure limits (NDL's), follow a safe ascent rate, and to perform a safety stop at five (5) metres for at least three minutes - longer if possible!\nIt is true to say that dive tables and dive computers track diver exposure times and ascent speeds. However, they do not guarantee any prevention or protection against the bends decompression sickness (DCS).\nPro Tip : Exposure to altitude, especially flying after scuba diving , too soon after surfacing can increase the risk of decompression sickness.\nRelated Information and Help Guides\nDAN Neurological Assessment: 5-Minute DCI Examination Explained\nDecompression Illness Signs, Symptoms, and Best Treatment\nHow Does In-Water Recompression Work in Scuba Diving?\nHow Would You Most Efficiently Provide Oxygen to a Breathing, Injured Diver?\nLung Overexpansion Injury Symptoms and First Aid Treatment\nOmitted Decompression Stops: What Happens if You Don't Decompress?\nWhat are the Typical Signs and Symptoms of a Scuba Diver in Shock?\nNote : The main section contains a comprehensive list of common scuba diving injuries that form part of an effective diving accident management flowchart .\nDivers also enjoyed reading about...\nCONTACT | PRIVACY | SITEMAP\n© 2003 - 2024\n",

Some injuries are small and relatively easy to cure or treat.\nIt could be a 'bad luck' leg scrape on the reef or an unpleasant reaction to skin contact with jellyfish tendrils.\nNonetheless some dive accidents need emergency care and urgent medical attention.\nDespite not expecting to encounter an injury or accident on every dive, you should be prepared for common casualties with some basic first aid kit supplies.\nKeep these simple but essential dive rescue items in your waterproof gear bag and you are instantly ready to minimize the damage.\nSimple Rescue Kit\n1. Soap and Water Bottle With Fresh Water A soft plastic squeezable water bottle is used to flush out most wounded areas. Use fresh water in the first instance to help irrigate and cleanse the injury. A small tablet of soap is very handy for cleaning wounds.\n2. Vinegar (white vinegar) White vinegar neutralizes jellyfish stinging venom. Irrigate jellyfish or fire coral nematocysts (with the exception of Portuguese man of war sting treatment ) and bristle-worm stings with lavish amounts of vinegar to reduce pain and discomfort.\n3. Tweezers and Razor or Shaving Kit A sharp razor blade or shaving kit is used to scrape away jellyfish bristles. Tweezers are the best tool to remove large jellyfish stingers and very useful for small embedded objects and splinters.\n4. Bandages and Gauze Pads Bandages and gauze pads are invaluable lightweight first aid items that do not take up much room in your gear bag. Use gauze pads to keep wounds, skin blisters and hot spots clean and bandages as a compression or immobilization bandage for severe bites and stings.\n5. Antibiotic Ointment and Pain Relievers Antibiotics ointments are helpful to treat topical wounds. Non-prescription pain relievers are useful to reduce pain and discomfort.\nContacting Emergency Medical Services (EMS)\nBe alert for severe swelling, breathing difficulties, dizziness, rapid heartbeat or any allergic reaction after a diving accident or injury. If any adverse symptoms occur contact the local EMS or DAN emergency hotline.\nMore Scuba Safety Tips |> Divers First Aid Kit |> Underwater Hand Signals |> Equalization techniques |\n*Consult your diving Doctor for suitable medications and advice on their use.\nDivers also enjoyed reading about...\nCONTACT | PRIVACY | SITEMAP\n© 2003 - 2024\n",

Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error on the part of the victim. Equipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba.\nAccording to death certificates, over 80% of the deaths were ultimately attributed to drowning, but other factors usually combined to incapacitate the diver in a sequence of events culminating in drowning, which is more a consequence of the medium in which the accidents occurred than the actual accident. Scuba divers should not drown unless there are other contributory factors as they carry a supply of breathing gas and equipment designed to provide the gas on demand. Drowning occurs as a consequence of preceding problems such as unmanageable stress, cardiac disease, pulmonary barotrauma, unconsciousness from any cause, water aspiration, trauma, environmental hazards, equipment difficulties, inappropriate response to an emergency or failure to manage the gas supply. and often obscures the real cause of death. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, and it, too is the consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, possibly aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.\nFatality rates are comparable with jogging (13 deaths per 100,000 persons per year) and are within the range where reduction is desirable by Health and Safety Executive (HSE) criteria, The most frequent root cause for diving fatalities is running out of or low on gas. Other factors cited include buoyancy control, entanglement or entrapment, rough water, equipment misuse or problems and emergency ascent. The most common injuries and causes of death were drowning or asphyxia due to inhalation of water, air embolism and cardiac events. Risk of cardiac arrest is greater for older divers, and greater for men than women, although the risks are equal by age 65.\nSeveral plausible opinions have been put forward but have not yet been empirically validated. Suggested contributing factors included inexperience, infrequent diving, inadequate supervision, insufficient predive briefings, buddy separation and dive conditions beyond the diver’s training, experience or physical capacity.\nDecompression sickness and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving have been associated with specific demographic, environmental, and diving behavioural factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, asthma, body mass index, gender, smoking, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, previous decompression illness, years since certification, number of dives in the previous year, number of consecutive diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, depth of the previous dive, use of nitrox as breathing gas, and use of a dry suit. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, diabetes or smoking. Greater dive depth, previous decompression illness, number of consecutive days diving, and male biological gender were associated with higher risk for decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism. The use of dry suits and nitrox breathing gas, greater frequency of diving in the previous year, greater age, and more years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.\nRisk management has three major aspects besides equipment and training: Risk assessment, emergency planning and insurance cover. The risk assessment for a dive is primarily a planning activity, and may range in formality from a part of the pre-dive buddy check for recreational divers, to a safety file with professional risk assessment and detailed emergency plans for professional diving projects. Some form of pre-dive briefing is customary with organised recreational dives, and this generally includes a recitation by the divemaster of the known and predicted hazards, the risk associated with the significant ones, and the procedures to be followed in case of the reasonably foreseeable emergencies associated with them. Insurance cover for diving accidents may not be included in standard policies. There are a few organisations which focus specifically on diver safety and insurance cover, such as the international Divers Alert Network\nEnvironmental factors The underwater environment is alien to humans. When not actively hostile, it is unforgiving of errors, and some errors can escalate rapidly to a fatal conclusion. Many aspects of the underwater environment are static or predictable, others vary and may not be easily or reliably predictable, and must be managed as found. The reasonably predictable factors can be allowed for in the dive planning. Suitable equipment can be selected, personnel can be trained in its use and support provided to manage the foreseeable contingencies. When conditions are found to be other than predicted, plans may have to be changed. Sometimes conditions are better than expected, but other times they may be worse, and may deteriorate during the course of a dive to the extent that recovery becomes an emergency.\nPredictable/static environmental factors – conditions which should be considered in the dive plan Variable environmental factors – conditions can change during a dive – dive contingency plans should take into account the reasonably foreseeable variations based on forecasts and local knowledge. When there is no reliable local knowledge, a wider range of contingencies should be considered.\nEquipment safety Two basic classes of equipment are used by divers: Equipment necessary to do the planned dive, and equipment required to do the task for which the dive is necessary. Recreational divers may not require equipment for a task, but it is quite common for them to use a camera, and some will survey a dive site, or use a small lift bag to recover an anchor or diving shot. There are no particularly significant risks associated with tools commonly used by recreational divers. Commercial divers usually use tools of some kind while diving, and some of these tools can be very dangerous if used incorrectly, such as high-pressure water-jets, explosive bolts, oxy-arc cutting and welding and heavy lifting equipment and rigging.\nScuba Open circuit scuba is mechanically robust and reliable, but can malfunction when damaged, misused, poorly maintained, or occasionally due to unplanned circumstances. Provision of a completely independent emergency supply capable of providing sufficient breathing gas to allow the diver to surface safely from any point on the planned dive profile reduces the risk of a non-survivable out of gas incident to an extremely low level. This remains valid only as long as the emergency gas supply is within immediate reach of the diver, which is more reliably achieved by the diver carrying a bailout cylinder than by relying on a buddy or standby diver, who may not be where needed in an emergency.\nRebreathers have an intrinsically much higher risk of mechanical failure than open circuit scuba because of their structural and functional complexity, but this can be mitigated by good design which provides redundancy of critical items and by carrying sufficient alternative breathing gas supplies for bailout including any required decompression in case of failure. Designs that minimize risk of human-machine interface errors, and adequate training in procedures that deal with this area may help reduce the fatality rate. Two thirds of fatalities were associated with high risk behaviour of a high risk dive profile.\nSurface-supplied equipment The essential aspect of surface-supplied diving is that breathing gas is supplied from the surface, either from a specialized diving compressor, high-pressure cylinders, or both. In commercial and military surface-supplied diving, a backup source of breathing gas should always be present in case the primary supply fails. The diver may also wear a cylinder called a “bail-out bottle,” which can provide self-contained breathing gas in an emergency. Thus, the surface-supplied diver is much less likely to have an “out-of-air” emergency than a scuba diver as there are normally two alternative air sources available. Surface-supplied diving equipment usually includes communication capability with the surface, which adds to the safety and efficiency of the working diver.\nSurface-supplied equipment is required under the US Navy operational guidance for diving in harsh contaminated environments which was drawn up by the Navy Experimental Diving Unit. Surface-supplied diving equipment is required for a large proportion of the commercial diving operations conducted in many countries, either by direct legislation, or by authorised codes of practice, as in the case of IMCA operations.\nHuman factors Human factors are the physical or cognitive properties of individuals, or social behavior which is specific to humans, and influence functioning of technological systems as well as human-environment equilibria. The safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur. Human error can be defined as an individual’s deviation from acceptable or desirable practice which culminates in undesirable or unexpected results.\nHuman error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time. The consequences of these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause significant harm, but others can have catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. In a high risk environment, as is the case in diving, human error is more likely to have catastrophic consequences. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career. These findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver’s judgment or performance, and may result in an accident. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of dive accidents and fatalities.\nOnly 4.46% of the recreational diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable to a single contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose as a result of a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in commercial scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to eliminate absolutely all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and would bring all diving to a halt.\nHumans function underwater by virtue of technology, as our physiology is poorly adapted to the environment. Human factors are significant in diving because of this harsh and alien environment, and because diver life support systems and other equipment that may be required to perform specific tasks depend on technology that is designed, operated and maintained by humans, and because human factors are cited as significant contributors to diving accidents in most accident investigations\nProfessional diving is a means to accomplish a wide range of activities underwater in a normally inaccessible and potentially hazardous environment. While working underwater, divers are subjected to high levels of physical and psychological stress due to environmental conditions and the limitations of the life support systems, as well as the rigours of the task at hand.\nRecreational, or sport divers, including technical divers, dive for entertainment, and are usually motivated by a desire to explore and witness, though there is no distinct division between the underwater activities of recreational and professional divers. The primary distinction is that legal obligations and protection are significantly different, and this is reflected in organisational structure and procedures.\nRecreational diving has been rated more risky than snow skiing, but less risky than other adventure sports such as rock climbing, bungee jumping, motorcycle racing and sky diving. Improvements in training standards and equipment design and configuration, and increased awareness of the risks of diving, have not eliminated fatal incidents, which occur every year in what is generally a reasonably safe recreational activity.\nBoth categories of diver are usually trained and certified, but recreational diving equipment is typically limited to freediving and scuba, whereas professional divers may be trained to use a greater variety of diving systems, from scuba to surface supplied mixed gas, saturation systems and atmospheric diving suits. A recreational diver may use some ancillary equipment to enhance the diving experience, but the professional will almost always use tools to perform a specific task.\nRelated Post\nScuba skills\nScuba skills are the skills required to dive safely using self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, (scuba).…\nDiving emergency ascent\nAn emergency ascent is an ascent to the surface by a diver in an emergency.…\nUnderwater diving\nUnderwater diving, as a human activity, is the practice of descending below the water's surface…\nSince the goal of recreational diving is personal enjoyment, a decision to abort a dive, for whatever reason, normally only affects the diver and his companions. A working diver faced with the same decision, must disappoint a client who needs and expects the diver’s services, often with significant financial consequences. Therefore, the working diver often faces greater pressure to provide the service at the cost of reduced personal safety. An understanding of the human factors associated with diving may help the diving team to strike an appropriate balance between service delivery and safety.\nHuman factors are the influences on human behavior, and the resulting effects of human performance on a process or system. Safety can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur. Human error can be defined as an individual’s deviation from acceptable or desirable practice which culminates in undesirable or unexpected results.\nDiver performance Safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur.

Most errors are minor and do not cause significant harm, but others can have catastrophic consequences. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of dive accidents and fatalities.\nInadequate learning or practice of critical safety skills may result in the inability to deal with minor incidents, which consequently may develop into major incidents.\nOverconfidence can result in diving in conditions beyond the diver’s competence, with high risk of accident due to inability to deal with known environmental hazards.\nInadequate strength or fitness for the conditions can result in inability to compensate for difficult conditions even though the diver may be well versed at the required skills, and could lead to over-exertion, overtiredness, stress injuries or exhaustion. Peer pressure can cause a diver to dive in conditions where they may be unable to deal with reasonably predictable incidents. Diving with an incompetent buddy can result in injury or death while attempting to deal with a problem caused by the buddy. Overweighting can cause difficulty in neutralising and controlling buoyancy, and this can lead to uncontrolled descent, inability to establish neutral buoyancy, inefficient swimming, high gas consumption, poor trim, kicking up silt, difficulty in ascent and inability to control depth accurately for decompression.\nUnderweighting can cause difficulty in neutralising and controlling buoyancy, and consequent inability to achieve neutral buoyancy, particularly at decompression stops.\nDiving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or with a hangover may result in inappropriate or delayed response to contingencies, reduced ability to deal timeously with problems, leading to greater risk of developing into an accident, increased risk of hypothermia and increased risk of decompression sickness.\nUse of inappropriate equipment and/or configuration can lead to a whole range of complications, depending on the details. High task loading due to a combination of these factors can result in a dive that goes well enough until something goes wrong, and the diver’s residual capacity is not enough to cope with the changed circumstances. This can be followed by a cascade of failures, as each problem loads the diver more and triggers the next. In such cases the diver is lucky to survive, even with the assistance of a buddy or team, and there is a significant risk of others becoming part of the accident.\nDive team performance A dive team can vary from a recreational buddy pair to a professional saturation diving team working 24 hours per day with dive and habitat support personnel on a dynamically positioned vessel. The primary purpose of a professional diving team is to improve safety for the working diver by providing backup and support, and to manage the surface equipment required for the operation. A buddy pair is also intended to improve the safety of recreational divers, and in some circumstances succeeds in this aim, depending on the skills, situational awareness and compliance with procedures of the divers. Technical diving teams can vary between the recreational buddy pair at its worst to expedition teams with structure, competence and planning similar to professional teams.\nFor many applications, the minimum personnel requirement for a professional diving operation is a working diver, to do the job, a diver’s tender to assist the diver and manage the umbilical or airline, a standby diver, competent and ready to go to the assistance of the working diver, and a supervisor, to co-ordinate the team, ensure that the plan is acceptably safe in terms of the organisational policies coded of practice and applicable legislation, ensure that the operation follows the plan as far as possible, and to manage any contingencies or emergencies that may come up during the operation. The primary responsibility of the supervisor of a professional diving team is the health and safety of the diving team.\nHazards Divers operate in an environment for which the human body is not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.\nProfessional divers may be exposed to a wider range of hazards, some of which are inherent in the equipment used to reduce the risk of other hazards. Saturation diving is intended to reduce a relatively high risk of decompression sickness, but introduces other health and safety hazards of living at a high ambient pressure for extended periods, and transfer between pressurised spaces. Failure of a saturation system can be catastrophic and fatal to the occupants and bystanders. Such failures are seldom engineering failures, they are more often ergonomic design and operation failures, and usually systems are corrected after analysis of such failures.\nConsequences Diving related medical conditions, are conditions associated with underwater diving, and include both conditions unique to underwater diving, and those that also occur during other activities. This second group further divides into conditions caused by exposure to ambient pressures significantly different from surface atmospheric pressure, and a range of conditions caused by general environment and equipment associated with diving activities.\nDisorders particularly associated with diving include those caused by variations in ambient pressure, such as barotraumas of descent and ascent, decompression sickness and those caused by exposure to elevated ambient pressure, such as some types of gas toxicity. There are also non-dysbaric disorders associated with diving, which include the effects of the aquatic environment, such as drowning, which also are common to other water users, and disorders caused by the equipment or associated factors, such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide poisoning. General environmental conditions can lead to another group of disorders, which include hypothermia and motion sickness, injuries by marine and aquatic organisms, contaminated waters, man-made hazards, and ergonomic problems with equipment. Finally there are pre-existing medical and psychological conditions which increase the risk of being affected by a diving disorder, which may be aggravated by adverse side effects of medications and other drug use.\nTreatment depends on the specific disorder, but often includes oxygen therapy, which is standard first aid for most diving accidents, and is hardly ever contra-indicated for a person medically fit to dive, and hyperbaric therapy is the definitive treatment for decompression sickness. Screening for medical fitness to dive can reduce some of the risk for some of the disorders.\nRisk The labels used to classify dives are not sufficiently precise for analysing risk. Terms like “recreational”, “technical”, “commercial”, “military”, “scientific” and “professional” are used but are not precisely defined, particularly for risk analysis as they do not identify specific contributors to diving risk. Categorisation by depth and obligation for decompression stops are also insufficient to classify risk.\nThe diving mode has a large influence on risk, and choice of diving mode is commonly based on the outcome of a risk assessment for the diving operation.\nHazard Identification and Risk Assessment: HIRA is a procedure applied to a project, and the results would be used to inform the planners on safety related issues such as choosing the appropriate diving mode, selection of equipment and dive team members, specialised training that may be required, and contingency and emergency planning. Job Safety Analysis: A (JSA) is a procedure which helps integrate accepted safety and health principles and practices into a particular task or job operation. In a JSA, each basic step of the analysis is to identify potential hazards and to recommend the safest way to do the job. In professional diving a JSA would be done for the planned task for a specific dive, and the result would be included in the dive briefing.\nRisk management Risk management has three major aspects besides equipment and training: Risk assessment, emergency planning and insurance cover. The risk assessment for a dive is primarily a planning activity, and may range in formality from a part of the pre-dive buddy check for recreational divers, to a safety file with professional risk assessment and detailed emergency plans for professional diving projects. Some form of pre-dive briefing is customary with organised recreational dives, and this generally includes a recitation by the divemaster of the known and predicted hazards, the risk associated with the significant ones, and the procedures to be followed in case of the reasonably foreseeable emergencies associated with them. Insurance cover for diving accidents may not be included in standard policies. There are a few organisations which focus specifically on diver safety and insurance cover, such as the international Divers Alert Network\nSource from Wikipedia\nShare\nTags:\nUnderwater diving\nRelated Post\nWhitewater sports tourism\nWhitewater sports are the art of bobbing about in a boat, large or small, in…\nSport in Afghanistan\nSport in Afghanistan is managed by the Afghan Sports Federation.

Divers Alert Network Japan (DAN Japan) membership includes insurance covering recreational diving-related injuries and fatalities. Use of claim data provides both a known denominator and demographic data about injured members. Methods: The study analysed 325 insurance claims reported to DAN Japan from 2010 to 2014. Four fatalities were excluded, leaving 321 claims for analysis. Claimants were divided into three age groups: young adults (< 40 years); middle-aged (40-59 years) and older adults (≥ 60 years). The total injury claims rate (ICR), decompression illness (DCI) rate (DCR) and trauma rate (TCR) were calculated. Differences between the sexes within each age group were analysed. Results: The total number of DAN Japan member-years in the period was 80,617, with a mean age of 45 years. Claims were made by 153 males and 168 females with a mean and median age of 46 years. Trauma was the most frequent reason for a claim (113 cases, 35%), followed by DCI (109 cases, 34%). The ICR (per 104 member-years) was 39.8 (95% confidence interval 35.5 to 44.2) and the TCR was 14.0 (11.4 to 16.6). For every age group, the ICR and TCR were significantly higher for females than males. The DCR was 13.5 (11.0 to 16.1) and did not significantly differ between the sexes. Conclusions: The incidence of trauma-related diving injuries exceeds that of claims related to DCI. Females appear to have a higher risk of injury than the general diving population.\nDiscover the world's research\n25+ million members\n160+ million publication pages\n2.3+ billion citations\nJoin for free\nNo full-text available\nTo read the full-text of this research, you can request a copy directly from the authors.\nRequest full-text PDF\nCitations (1)\nReferences (11)\n...

Studies supporting injury-management efficacy from early recognition to first-aid, final treatment and outcome are also lacking. This study aims at making an epidemiologic inventory of DI among French scuba divers. Methods: This online, retrospective, cross-sectional survey analyzed self-reported symptoms, context of occurrence, initial response and outcome. The relationships between symptoms and diver characteristics were assessed and severity scores created from the reports. Results: A total of 799 divers responded, of whose questionnaires 784 were sufficiently complete to be analyzed. Approximately one-third (35%) of respondents had never experienced a DI. DCI-like symptoms represent a small fraction of DIs, the most commonly reported being ear barotrauma. Self-reported symptom rates decreased with increasing age and male sex. The ranking dive leader was the primary care provider in 58% of reports and 32% of injured divers never sought help. Management decisions (first aid and/or hyperbaric oxygen treatment) were related to the severity score. Complete resolution was achieved in 84 (74%) of 114 DCI cases, whilst mild (n = 22, 19%) and severe (n = 8, 7%) residual symptoms were reported. One in 10 divers who did not seek treatment for symptoms believed to be related to DCI declared some residual symptoms. Conclusion: Based on these results, diving injury rates may be higher than previously reported. However, the most frequent symptoms appear to be of only a modest nature.\nView\nShow abstract\nScuba diving injuries among Divers Alert Network members 2010– 2011\nArticle\nFull-text available\nJul 2014\nShabbar Ranapurwala\nNicholas Bird\nPanchabi Vaithiyanathan\nPetar J Denoble\nBackground: Scuba diving injuries vary greatly in severity and prognosis. While decompression sickness (DCS) and arterial gas embolism can be tracked easily, other forms of diving injury remain unaccounted for. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess rates of overall self-reported scuba-diving-related injuries, self-reported DCS-like symptoms, and treated DCS and their association with diver certification level, diving experience and demographic factors. Methods: We analyzed self-reported data from a Divers Alert Network membership health survey conducted during the summer of 2011. Poisson regression models with scaled deviance were used to model the relative rates of reported injuries. Models were adjusted for sex, age, body mass index (BMI) and average annual dives, based on the bias-variance tradeoff. Results: The overall rate of diving-related injury was 3.02 per 100 dives, self-reported DCS symptoms was 1.55 per 1,000 dives and treated DCS was 5.72 per 100,000 dives. Diving-related injury and self-reported DCS symptom rates decreased for higher diver certification levels, increasing age, increasing number of average annual dives and for men; they increased for increasing BMI. Conclusions: Diving injury rates may be higher than previously thought, indicating a greater burden on the diving community. Self-reported DCS-like symptoms are a small fraction of all dive-related injuries and those receiving treatment for DCS are an even smaller fraction. The small number of divers seeking treatment may suggest the mild nature and a tendency towards natural resolution for most injuries.\nView\nShow abstract\nScuba injury death rate among insured DAN members\nArticle\nFull-text available\nDec 2008\nPetar J Denoble\nNeal W. Pollock\nPanchabi Vaithiyanathan\nRichard Vann\nWe calculated the annual rates of diving-related deaths among DAN-insured members in the period from 2000 to 2006 and investigated the effects of age and sex on death rate by logistic regression. We determined relative risks for divers < 50 and ≥ 50 years of age for drowning, arterial gas embolism, and cardiac incidents, the three most common disabling injuries associated with diving death. There were 1,141,367 insured member-years and 187 diving-related deaths. Males made up 64% of the members. Individuals ≥ 50 years of age constituted 31% of the fatalities. Insured mean age increased from 40 ± 12 to 43 ± 13 years over the seven-year study period. Annual fatality rates varied between 12.1 and 22.9 (average 16.4, 95% confidence intervals 14.2, 18.9) per 100,000 persons insured. The relative risk for male divers in their thirties was six times greater than the risk for female divers in the same age range. Fatality rates increased with age for both sexes, but the higher relative risk for males progressively decreased until the rates became similar for both sexes after age 60. Death associated with cardiac incidents was 12.9 times more likely in divers ≥ 50 years of age. We recommend that older divers adjust their participation in diving according to health status and physical fitness, maintain fitness with regular exercise, and abstain from diving in conditions likely to require unaccustomed physical activity.\nView\nShow abstract\nPer-capita claims rates for decompression sickness among insured Divers Alert Network members\nArticle\nFull-text available\nJun 2012\nUNDERSEA HYPERBAR M\nPetar J Denoble\nShabbar Ranapurwala\nPanchabi Vaithiyanathan\nRichard Vann\nDecompression sickness (DCS) in recreational diving is a rare and usually self-limiting injury, but permanent disability can occur. Incidence rate estimates are difficult to establish because the number of divers at risk is usually unknown in population samples with well-documented DCS. We estimated the annual per-capita DCS incidence rates for 2000-2007 based on insurance claims submitted by members of the Divers Alert Network (DAN), Durham, N.C., with dive accident insurance. The overall per-capita DCS claims rate (DCR) was 20.5 per 10,000 member-years. Based on the age-adjusted DCR, males submitted 28% more claims than females. Male-to-female difference was greatest between 35 and 40 years of age and disappeared by the mid-50s. Highest rates were observed in the 30- to 39-year age category, after which DCR declined with increasing age. Highest yearly DCR was estimated in 2002. Insurance dropout rate was greater among those who had DCS in the first year of their insurance compared to those who did not have DCS in their first year.\nView\nShow abstract\nDecompression sickness and recreational scuba divers\nArticle\nFull-text available\nAug 2003\nEMERG MED J\nH Nakayama\nMasatoshi Shibayama\nN Yamami\nYoshihiro Mano\nThe aim of this study is to clear the status of recreational scuba divers in Japan for promoting safety in recreational diving. A five year (from 1996 to 2001) questionnaire survey was performed of Japanese divers at the Osezaki area in Japan. The subjects of this survey included diving instructors as well as recreational divers. Based on the obtained data, the study investigated the theory predicted incidence of decompression sickness (DCS) among Japanese recreational divers. The average (SD) of the maximum depth for diving was 37.4 (13.1) metres, which was deeper than the recommended depth of recreational diving. The incident rate of nitrogen narcosis (12%) was the most frequent, followed by barotraumas of the ear (11%) and barotraumas of the paranasal sinus (5.6%). The rate of DCS was 1.9 % (60 divers) during investigated period, and that DCS occurred once per 19 011 dives in calculation. This investigation showed that the status of leisure diving in Japan is still serious, because DCS would be expected to occur once a weekend in Japan. It is speculated that many divers may develop DCS while moving through high altitudes after diving, particularly at the Osezaki diving spot in Japan. Based on the results of this study, it is emphasised that every Japanese leisure diver should take an increasing interest in the safety of diving activity.\nView\nShow abstract\nIncidence and outcome of osteoporotic fractures in 2004 in Sado City, Niigata Prefecture, Japan\nArticle\nFull-text available\nFeb 2008\nMayumi Sakuma\nNaoto Endo\nTakeo Oinuma\nSatoshi Watanabe\nOsteoporotic fracture in elderly populations is increasing worldwide, but there are few data on the incidence and outcome of osteoporotic fractures, including upper extremity and vertebral fracture, during a certain period in a defined geographic area. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of osteoporotic fractures in a particular area: Sado City, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. From January to December 2004, osteoporotic fractures of the vertebra, hip, distal radius, and proximal humerus in Sado City were recorded. The incidence, age, gender, type of fracture (for hip fracture), right or left side (for distal radius, proximal humerus, and hip fracture), place of injury, cause of injury, outcome, hospitalization period, and patient status regarding taking of drugs for osteoporosis treatment were checked for each fracture. The incidence was calculated based on the whole population of Sado City. The incidence per 100,000 population was 232.8, 121.4, 108.6, and 37.1 for fractures of the vertebra, hip, distal radius, and proximal humerus, respectively. The total incidence of these four kinds of fracture was 499.9 per 100,000 persons per year. The average age at the time of injury was 81.4, 77.7, 75.7, and 60.2 years old for fractures of the hip, vertebra, proximal humerus, and distal radius, respectively. As the average age increased, the percentage of fractures that occurred indoors also increased; that is, a higher percentage of hip fractures occurred indoors, followed by fractures of the vertebra, proximal humerus, and distal radius. Most patients were not taking anti-osteoporosis drugs before fractures of the hip or vertebra. We determined the incidence of major osteoporotic fractures in 1 year in a defined geographic area. Our data showed that 81% of hip fracture patients also had a vertebral fracture and that the average age at the time of injury was higher for hip fractures than for vertebral fractures. Therefore, these results suggest that vertebral fracture leads to hip fracture, indicating that early fracture prevention and continuous prevention strategies through positive treatment are of importance in osteoporotic elderly people.\nView\nShow abstract\nDecompression illness and other injuries in a recreational dive charter operation\nArticle\nDec 2018\nMarion Hubbard\nF Michael Davis\nKate Malcolm\nSimon J Mitchell\nIntroduction: Health and safety within the recreational diving industry are poorly described. We aimed to obtain the true prevalence of decompression illness (DCI) and other diving and non-diving injuries, including occupational injuries, in a large recreational diving charter operation. Methods: A New Zealand recreational diving operator keeps detailed records of diving activity and event/incident reports. We extracted passenger and crew numbers, dive numbers and incident statistics from all boat trips and associated work-related injuries between 01 January 2008 and 31 December 2014. The records of divers referred to the regional hyperbaric unit for suspected DCI were reviewed retrospectively. Using these data the prevalence of DCI and non-diving injuries were calculated. Results: There were 65,536 person-trips to sea and 57,072 divers undertook 97,144 dives. Fifty-five injury events were documented over seven years, 31 in customers and 24 in staff. Four divers (including one staff member) diagnosed with DCI underwent recompression therapy, giving a prevalence of 0.41 cases requiring recompression per 10,000 dives, or one case per 24,386 dives, whilst five other divers were assessed as not having DCI. There was one cardiac-related fatality. Thirty-five non-diving injuries (mainly lacerations and minor musculoskeletal injuries) were documented in 30 people resulting in 10 consulting a general practitioner and seven presenting to the local regional hospital emergency department. Conclusions: DCI requiring recompression was relatively rare in this supervised recreational diving operation. Minor non-diving injuries were the most common adverse event. Compared to other adventure sports, the prevalence of injury in recreational scuba diving is low.\nView\nShow abstract\nEpidemiology of morbidity and mortality in US and Canadian recreational scuba diving\nArticle\nJan 2018\nPeter Buzzacott\nD Schiller\nJennifer Crain\nPetar J Denoble\nObjectives: This study investigates morbidity and mortality suffered by divers in the USA and Canada. Study design: Prospectively recruited probability-weighted sample for estimating the national burden of injury and a weighted retrospective survey for estimating exposure. Methods: The National Electronic Surveillance System and Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) were searched for scuba diving injuries. The Divers Alert Network diving fatality database was searched for deaths, and Sports and Fitness Industry Association estimates for diving were obtained from annual surveys. Results: In the USA, there were an estimated 1394 emergency department (ED) presentations annually for scuba-related injuries. The majority (80%) were treated and/or released. There were an estimated 306 million dives made by the US residents 2006-2015 and concurrently 563 recreational diving deaths, a fatality rate of 0.18 per 105 dives and 1.8 per 105 diver-years. There were 658 diving deaths in the US 2006-2015 and 13,943 ED presentations for scuba injuries, giving a ratio of 47 diving deaths in the USA for every 1000 ED presentations. There were 98 cases of scuba-related injuries identified in the CHIRPP data. The prevalence of scuba-related injuries for patients aged 3-17 years was 1.5 per 105 cases, and the prevalence of scuba-related injuries to patients 18-62 years was 16.5 per 105 cases. Discussion: In Canada and the USA, only one out of every 10,000 ED presentations is due to a scuba-related injury. That there are 47 deaths for every 1000 ED presentations for scuba injuries speaks to the relatively unforgiving environment in which scuba diving takes place. For 1.8 deaths per million recreational dives, mortality in scuba diving is nonetheless relatively low.\nView\nShow abstract\nReview of scuba diving fatalities and decompression illness in Australia\nArticle\nJun 2008\nJohn Lippmann\nRecreational scuba diving is a popular activity in Australia, especially around the Great Barrier Reef. Despite efforts by the industry and various governments to reduce the risk, there remains substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of diving. The aim of this study was to estimate the historical and current risk of death and decompression illness associated with scuba diving in Australia. Data were collected through comprehensive internet searches of various journals and electronic databases using appropriate general and medical search engines, hand searches of relevant journals, searches of the DAN Asia-Pacific dive fatality and decompression illness databases, and consultation with various recompression facilities, and diver certification agencies and dive industry bodies. There were 566 diving fatalities reported between 1972 and 2006, of which 290 divers were using scuba. In addition, a total of 3,558 divers were treated for decompression illness in Australian chambers during 1995-2007 financial years. Using recent surveys of scuba diving activity, it can be estimated that there were in excess of 1.75 million scuba dives conducted in Australia in 2006. On the basis of the available data, the mortality rate in scuba divers in Australia can be estimated to be 0.57 per 100,000 dives during 2002-2006. Similarly, the incidence of decompression illness during that period in Australia was 10.74 per 100,000 dives or lower. There has been no significant increase in the annual number of scuba diving fatalities from 1972 to 2006.\nView\nShow abstract\nDiving Accidents in Sports Divers in Orkney Waters\nArticle\nJan 2002\nAJ Trevett\nR Forbes\nC K Rae\nR Stephenson\nScapa Flow in Orkney is one of the major world centres for wreck diving. Because of the geography of Orkney and the nature of the diving, it is possible to make relatively accurate estimates of the number of dives taking place. The denominator of dive activity allows the unusual opportunity of precise calculation of accident rates. In 1999, one in every 178 sports divers visiting Orkney was involved in a significant accident, in 2000 the figure was one in 102. Some of these accidents appear to have been predictable and could be avoided by better education and preparation of visiting divers.\nView\nShow abstract\nScuba-diving related deaths in Okinawa, Japan, from 1982 to 2007\nArticle\nJun 2008\nLeg Med\nYoko Ihama\nTetsuji Miyazaki\nChiaki Fuke\nYoshinobu Sato\nWe reviewed the autopsies of scuba-diving related deaths (SDRDs) that were collected from April 1982 until March 2007. In the period under consideration, a total of 40 SDRDs were registered, out of which 34 were males and 6 females. Ages ranged from 19 to 65 years, with the average of 41.5 years (SD=12.9). Divers over the age of 40 accounted for 60% of all fatalities. The major cause of death was drowning (62.5%), followed by disease (28.5%). The average age for drowning and disease-related deaths was 38.6 (SD=12.8) and 48.7 years (SD=10.1), respectively. Of the 40 fatalities, 24 were beginners who had little or no experience. In this study, we compared SDRDs in the first term, from April 1982 to March 1995, and in the second term, from April 1995 to March 2007. The average age in the first and second terms was 35.4 and 45.2 years, respectively; the average age for the second term was 10 years older than the first. Of those in the first term, 13.3%, and of those in the second term, 40.0%, died from complications arising from already existing conditions. This study revealed that the onset of diseases during diving frequently causes fatal accidents, especially for older divers.\nView\nShow abstract\nRecommended publications\nDiscover more\nArticle\nFull-text available\nDecompression sickness of the inner ear and relationship with a patent oval foramen: a study of 61 c...\nMarch 2024 · European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology\nRaphaële Quatre\nBertrand Delafosse\nSébastien Schmerber\n[...]\nEdouard Soriano\nObjective To discuss the link between inner ear decompression sickness and patent foramen ovale. Materials and methods Monocentric and retrospective study on decompression sickness of the inner ear requiring hyperbaric chamber treatment, from 2014 to 2021. Results Sixty-one patients of inner ear decompression sickness were included in this study. Twenty-four patients had vestibular injuries, 28 ... [Show full abstract] cochlear injuries and 9 cochleo-vestibular injuries. Compression chamber treatment was given, using an oxygen–helium mixture with oxygen partial pressure (PIO2) limited to 2.8 atmosphere absolute (ATA). All vestibular accidents completely recovered without clinical sequelae. For cochlear accident only 10 out of 37 patients (27%) recovered completely. A right–left shunt (patent foramen oval or intra-pulmonary shunt) was found in 31.1% of patients with inner ear decompression sickness (p > 0.05). Conclusion The presence of patent foramen oval in patients with inner ear decompression was not statistically significant in our study. Understanding of the pathophysiology of decompression illness and the physiology and anatomy of the labyrinth would suggest a mechanism of supersaturation with degassing in intra-labyrinthine liquids.\nView full-text\nPreprint\nFull-text available\nImpact of Transesophageal Echocardiographic Parameters on Procedure-Related Radiation Exposure in Pe...\nMarch 2024\nAyşe İrem Demirtola\nAnar Mammadli\nDuygu İnan\n[...]\nAlev Kilicgedik\nBackground: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a cardiac congenital anomaly with a prevalence of 20% to 30% in the general population, associated with clinical conditions such as cryptogenic stroke, migraine, and decompression sickness. Percutaneous PFO closure has been proven superior to medical treatment alone for PFO-related stroke, exhibiting a favorable safety profile. However, the procedure's ... [Show full abstract] radiation exposure necessitates a deeper understanding of the influencing factors, especially the impact of PFO anatomical characteristics on radiation dose and procedural time. Methods: This study analyzed 83 patients undergoing transcatheter PFO closure for CS. The study evaluated the relationship between the anatomical features of PFO and radiation exposure, measured by Air Kerma. Increased radiation exposure was defined as falling within the highest quintile (5th quantile) of the Air Kerma. Statistical analyses included univariate and multivariate logistic regression and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: The study population had a mean age of 40.9 ± 9.0 years, with a slight male predominance (51.8%). The median fluoroscopy time was 10.9 minutes, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 7.5 to 19.9 minutes. The median Air Kerma value was 149 mGy (IQR, 83 – 311). In the multivariate regression analysis, a shorter aortic rim length was identified as an independent predictor of increased radiation exposure, with an odds ratio of 2.01 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 – 3.1; P=0.002). In the ROC analysis, the aortic rim length demonstrated good predictive value for increased radiation exposure, with an area under the curve of 0.872 (95% CI, 0.791 – 0.953; P<0.001). A cutoff value of less than 4.5 mm for the aortic rim length was associated with an 88% sensitivity and 80% specificity in predicting increased radiation exposure. Conclusion: A short aortic rim length is associated with increased radiation exposure during percutaneous closure of PFO.\nView full-text\nArticle\nFull-text available\nRisk Factors for Decompression Sickness\nMarch 2024 · Jurnal Multidisiplin Indonesia\nElsye Fitriasari\nNi Komang Sri Dewi Untari\n[...]\nNasywa Annisa Fitra\nOver the past few decades, self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving has gained popularity globally. Efforts to explore new trails underwater have rapidly expanded recreational, technical, professional, and military diving opportunities. Decompression sickness (DCS) is an essential and complex health problem among divers, stemming from changes in environmental pressure during ... [Show full abstract] and after underwater travel. Understanding the various risk factors associated with DCS is critical in implementing safe diving practices. Medical professionals, regardless of specialization, need to be aware of the adverse effects of changes in exposure to environmental stresses on the human body. Decompression sickness (DCS) can occur quickly, immediately, or very mildly and is delayed. Divers with DCS can arrive late, far from the dive site, due to their varied presentation, slow start, and air travel after diving. Medical personnel must consider the previous days' activities and be aware of diving problems and disorders to take advantage of the opportunity to diagnose and treat such patients appropriately. Individual and environmental risk factors play a role in increasing the incidence of DCS in divers, including obesity, smoking, alcohol, anxiety disorders, comorbidities, previous injuries, cold water, duration, and depth of diving. A comprehensive understanding of these multifaceted risk elements is essential for divers and medical professionals. Armed with this knowledge, they can better assess potential risks, adopt proactive precautions, and ensure diver safety, ultimately reducing severe DCS incidents.\nView full-text\nPreprint\nFull-text available\n“Decompression illness” on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation\nJanuary 2024\nJiannan Hu\nHuijing zhao\nBingBing Bian\n[...]\nYongpo Jiang\nBackground Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is increasingly being used for critically ill patients with cardiopulmonary failure. Air in the ECMO circuit is an emergency, a rare but fatal complication. Case presentation We introduce a case of a 76-year-old female who suffered from cardiac arrest complicated with severe trauma and was administered veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane ... [Show full abstract] oxygenation. In managing the patient with ECMO, air entered the ECMO circuit, which had not come out nor was folded or broken. Although the ECMO flow was quickly re-established, the patient died 6 hours after initiating ECMO therapy. Conclusions In this case report, the reason for the complication is drainage insufficiency. This phenomenon is similar to decompression sickness. Understanding this complication is very helpful for educating the ECMO team for preventing this rare but devastating complication of fatal decompression sickness in patients on ECMO.\nView full-text\nLooking for the full-text?\nYou can request the full-text of this article directly from the authors on ResearchGate.\nRequest full-text\nAlready a member?

As a result, diving at Koh Chang Island is a much-improved destination for a scuba vacation.\nThe huge vessel was originally built in Philadelphia for the US Navy in 1944 to assist with the Pacific war efforts.\nThe boat was capable of transporting troops, tanks and gear directly to the shores of countries that were engaged in the conflicts.\nThe USS Lincoln County was given the hull number 898 and its first trips involved the invasion of imperial Japan at Okinawa. She was later decommissioned in March of 1961.\nFor almost 50 years, the tank landing ship provided transport for troops and vehicles for the Navy. Then, 712 HTMS Chang was moored near Bangkok in 2006 and partly gutted out.\nThe Navy then decided to sink it as an artificial reef in the vicinity of Koh Chang Island, a popular holiday destination with tourists.\nIts journey to the southeastern island (near the Cambodian border) was executed by two tugboats. It arrived on Koh Chang's Navy pier in July 2012.\nNote : The daily boat trips in Koh Chang offer divers the full range of ' Discovery Programs ', PADI® Certification Courses , and a selection of Technical Diving opportunities.\nArticle First Published 2012\nThai Navy Ship Sinks at Pattaya Coastline\nThe small vessel, HTMS Mataphon , was slowly lowered to the bottom of the seabed by a floating crane on the morning of the 20th of October.\nThey chose Had Nuan Beach on the coral island of Koh Larn (a short boat trip from the Port) as a good location for the intentional sinking.\nThis new shipwreck is smaller than the other two wrecks, HTMS Khram and HTMS Kut . Even so, it gives local scuba divers an alternative dive site for wreck diving adventures.\nArticle First Published 2012\nScience and Innovation\nUsing Robots to Help Regrow Coral Reefs\nThe power of robots is rarely contested. Now, thanks to an Australian scientist, robotic technology is helping to regrow vulnerable reefs in the azure waters of the Abrolhos Islands (400 kilometres north of Perth).\nThis pioneering project is able to cultivate coral by harvesting fragments taken from the ocean.\nThen, robots glue them onto special plugs and insert them into the limestone base.\nFinally, scuba divers plant the entire skeletons back into the ocean for regeneration.\nThis process bypasses years of calcification by providing them with a premade skeleton.\nThe company, called Coral Maker, reiterates that having humans conduct assisted migration of coral by hand is laborious and costly. After teaming up with AI business Autodesk, robots are performing the repetitive tasks much quicker, and could eventually be cultivating around 100 hectares of coral per year.\nPro Tip : Another section contains essential information about reef producing coral and how these ecosystems provide habitats for more than 800,000 species worldwide.\nThailand Scientists Breeding Corals in the Laboratory\nA team of scientists in Thailand collected coral eggs and sperm to breed in the lab. If nurturing the coral spawn becomes successful they will return it to the site near Ko Man Nai, a tiny island in the Mu Ko Man archipelago.\nRestoring degraded corals helps to reduce the impact on scuba diving tourism in the north eastern Gulf of Thailand and the local fisheries that depend on healthy reef systems.\nThe Department of Marine and Coastal Resources started the coral breeding and restoration project in 2016. They chose the southern island of Ko Man Nai because it provides habitats for almost 100 different species of coral .\nDespite losing 90% of Thailand's reefs in 2010, thought to be due to rising water temperatures, the department claims to have already restored around 4,000 coral colonies.\nPro Tip : The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says that another mass coral bleaching event is imminent. If it happens, it would likely wipe out huge swathes of tropical reefs around the world.\nCave Diver Stretches World Depth Record to 308 Metres\nA French cave-diver named Frédéric Swierczynski claimed a new world depth record of 308 metres.\nThe seven-hour descent into the Font Estramar spring in the eastern Pyrenees took place on the 3rd of November 2023.\nDespite experiencing a succession of \"strange symptoms\" (due to rapid depth changes) he broke the previous official record of 283 metres set by South African diver Nuño Gomez in 1996 at the Boesmansgat sinkhole.\nNote : Another section explains how to get a cave diving certification and acquire the special skills and knowledge to do it safely.\nInnovative Dive Suit Won't Need Decompression\nThe United States Navy is trying to develop a dive suit that removes the need for decompression at depth. They are calling it the Deep Sea Expeditionary with No Decompression (DSEND) suit.\nThey said the DSEND dive suit is lightweight, flexible, and will have significant improvements in its rotary joint design. It is meant to protect the wearer against the effects of water pressure, such as during deep sea dives.\nNote : The Navy is currently using the Atmospheric Diving Suit (ADS). But, it is heavy and it lacks maneuverability. Thus, they need large sea craft to deploy it.\nCamping in an Underwater 'Tent'\nA portable life-support system - called the 'Ocean Space Habitat' - is making its mark with scuba divers and ocean explorers.\nThe pioneering submersible 'tent' facilitates deeper and longer submersions than the conventional Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA) usually allows.\nKey takeaways :\nIt means several divers can swim up together and take cover inside the dry chamber. They can use the tent to decompress, eat, and even take a nap while they rest beneath the surface waves.\nPro Tip : Another section explains more about in water recompression treatment and why it is still used for divers with DCS symptoms in some countries.\nThe World's First Hydrogen Rebreather Dive\nDr. Richard Harris conducted the first hydrogen (H) rebreather dive (in February of 2023). He tested the new innovative system to a depth of 230 metres (755 feet) at Pearse Resurgence, a water filled cave in New Zealand.\nWhy?\nThe dive took more than thirteen (13) hours to complete and the primary objectives were to:\nDetermine the practicality and efficacy of using hydrogen as a dive gas.\nImprove the safety and performance when making ultra-deep scuba dives.\nNote : The results and full details will be presented at Rebreather Forum 4 in April at Valletta, in Malta.\nAustralia Funds the Fight against Reef-Eating Starfish\nThe battle against the crown-of-thorns starfish in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is relentless. As a result, the foundation is planning to deploy several new innovations, including:\nEnvironmental DNA\nGenetics\nNatural predators\nPheromones\nRobotics\nThe Great Barrier Reef Foundation intends to unleash next-generation tools. The aim is to predict, detect, and then respond appropriately to deadly outbreaks of coral-eating starfish.\nNote : Another section explains why the crown of thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) is one of the largest coral-eating marine invertebrate sea stars.\nApeks Luna X Umbilical Dive Torch\nThe new innovative Luna-X torch by Apeks is ideal for communicating underwater and illuminating wide areas.\nIt is corrosion resistant and rugged enough to withstand the harshest of diving environments. It is lightweight, strong, and it reduces backscatter in murky water.\nThe new torch is flexible too. You can attach it to a BCD , scuba cylinder , or you can rotate it for use on sidemount applications .\nIntelligent Thermal Management\nPatented circuitry reduces power to the LEDs if they go beyond the optimum temperature. Doing so keeps the light shining as efficiently as possible to help maximise the output and battery capacity.\nSuitable for Air Travel\nThe battery size falls under the maximum allowed by airlines. Moreover, it meets the requirement for detaching the light head before traveling by air.\nFuel Gauge\nThe LED display panel provides instant, real-time information on the actual runtime remaining (in hours and minutes).\nDual Beam Modes\nIt has two (2) different types of beam (e.g. flood mode, spot mode, or a combination). This means you can choose the best beam for the dive environment.\nNote : Another section contains information about underwater dive torches with equipment reviews and tips for beginners.\nScuba Industry Innovation Hunt\nRecent estimates suggest there are nine million active divers worldwide. Thus, the opportunity for growth (e.g. through the acquisition of new innovative products) is huge.\nAs a result, a global hunt for the 'next big thing' is in full force in the scuba diving , snorkeling , and freediving industries.\nThis step is important :\nSo, how can you participate in the hunt? It's simple, you need to submit your unique idea to any of the participating companies (e.g. listed on the MarketBlast open innovation platform).\nBut, to make a submission, you need to be one of the following:\nInnovator\nManufacturer\nProduct engineer\nProfessional developer\nSupplier\nStart-up company\nImportant : After creating an account, new submitters will not be subject to any upfront costs or commissions.\nRecreational Divers become Citizen Scientists\nThere are many ways that citizen scientists can help conduct scientific research. This particular task was one that involved the collection of data about the largest known population of manta rays in the world.\nA team of recreational scuba divers helped to populate the database of some 22,000 mantas off the coast of Ecuador in South America.\nMarine biologists already know manta rays live in small groups of up to fifty (50) individuals. But, this new discovery was an impressively large collection. In fact, it was the largest ever confirmed and recorded.\nIn case you were wondering :\nThe scientific name for the giant oceanic manta ray is Mobula birostris . They are the largest species of ray.\nThe wingspan of these elasmobranchs can extend over six metres (20 feet). Most of their existence is spent filter feeding on krill and zooplankton ( animal component of the planktonic community ) as they glide through tropical and subtropical waters.\nScuba Training and Education\nPADI Equivalents\nDid you ever ask yourself... Why should I choose PADI for my scuba diving credentials? And, what is the difference between the top five scuba training agencies anyway?\nSome divers trained by another certifying agency would like to switch their certification and crossover to PADI.\nThe list of PADI equivalent qualifications explains how to continue your journey and enter the PADI system of diver education.\nThe comprehensive checklist represents all the popular scuba training agencies around the world (including BSAC, CMAS, SSI, and NAUI) and their corresponding level of certification.\nSafety Point Reminders for All PADI Professionals\nDespite being an uncommon occurrence, fatal incidents involving PADI professionals do happen. As a result, the most popular of the different diver training organisations issued a statement to serve as a reminder about safety standards and practices.\nThe majority of diving professionals put safety first. Even so, recent fatal incidents occurred due to standards violations. There is no room in the industry for abandoning sound judgement or ignoring dive-community practices.\n5 Safety Measures Pros Need to Obey\nThe Professional Association of Diving Instructors shared five safety points for all dive professionals to follow.\nThese key areas should be at the forefront of diver supervision, course training, and every business decision.\nAll scuba professionals must follow the relevant and appropriate course safety standards and community safe-diving practices. The scuba training agency highlights the fact that any minor deviation is likely to increase the potential for a serious incident.\nDive-safety procedures should overlap and repeat to create 'layers' and 'close the gap'. Thus, no single procedure accounts for all variables (e.g. human error).\nThe accepted and recognised safety standards and practices work best when adapted to local conditions and the ability of each individual. Nonetheless, it's important to rely on conservative good judgement and reasoned application. Always choose the most conservative option if you have any doubt, such as for depths, ratios, and equipment.\nSome of the variables we can't control include human reactions, the weather, and the diving conditions. Thus, safety procedures are dynamic and updated at regular intervals. PADI says... \"in general, there is no reason or excuse for violating established dive training standards and procedures.\"\nThe actions you make as a diving professional must be \"visible and unmistakable\". They should reflect what is taught and follow the best practices - without any reasonable exception. So for example, data clearly shows that overlooking pre-dive safety checks is commonplace in many scuba and snorkeling accidents and incidents\nNote : PADI® offers a free downloadable Pre-dive Safety Check poster. We are building a database that tracks the number of scuba diving deaths per year based on the findings of the DAN Annual Diving Report.\nCourt Overturns Diver's Conviction of Involuntary Manslaughter\nThis latest court decision is one that affects all divers who use the ' scuba diving buddy system '. For example, do you know what responsibilities you have for your buddy while you're diving together... and what are the legal implications if something goes wrong?\nThis is what happened :\nThis week, a court in Malta cleared a diver on appeal for having caused the death of his female dive buddy in Gozo, November 2020.\nShe was a soldier in the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM). But, she died following a scuba incident. The court originally convicted her diving partner with involuntary manslaughter. At the time, the decision caused outrage among the diving community.\nBack in 2020, the court's interpretation of the 'buddy system' had been a vital factor in the original conviction of involuntary manslaughter. In fact, one expert said:\n“The whole scope of the diving buddy system is for the two divers to be close to each other to assist each other in any untoward event during the dive.”\nCleared of All Criminal Liability\nThe revised clarification interprets the scuba buddy system as being \"two individuals who are there for each other, to assist each other\" .\nThus, it does not mean that the two diving buddies were responsible for each other while they were diving together.\nThis case is not typical of some scuba diving accidents whereby a negligent instructor is involved. In fact, these two divers were long-term friends who had dived together on several occasions.\nThe courts in Malta quashed the original charges of criminal liability, stating: \"he was not negligent and could not have prevented the incident from happening\" .\nCan You Scuba Dive If You Wear Glasses?\nThere are certain medical conditions that you cannot dive with, such as severe uncontrolled asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).\nBut, the good news is that needing contact lenses or spectacles to help you see better does not stop you from diving.\nSo, even though the answer is a yes, and people with bad eyesight can scuba dive, it's important to understand that you can't actually wear glasses under a scuba mask.\nSome simple fixes for people with impaired vision include:\nPrescription scuba mask\nSoft contact lenses (daily disposables)\nTip for Beginners : A process called refraction magnifies your vision underwater. In short, objects will appear bigger and closer. So, some people who want to go scuba diving with glasses may not need to buy a special mask with prescription lenses.\nIs Your Emergency Action Plan Good Enough?\nDivers should never underestimate the importance of having a structured plan to follow if there is an emergency.\nIn general, there are three key steps to include in any effective response. So, how powerful is your PADI Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and is there anything you can add to make it better?\nThe bottom line is this:\nDespite being an uncommon event, scuba diving accidents and horror stories happen.\nAs a result, now could be a good time to review your EAP and consider the logistics of emergency management.\nImportant : Three parts of an effective response are being able to commit it to memory, manage the scene, and handle the logistics with clear, concise, communication.\nSnorkeling and Freediving Newsletters\nConstant Weight (CWT) Apnea: New World Record\nAlexey Molchanov (INT) achieved a new world record for Constant Weight (CWT) freediving on the 21st of August 2023.\nUsing a monofin, he dove to an absolute world record depth of one hundred and thirty six metres (446 feet) in the Caribbean Sea at Roatan, Honduras.\nPro Tip : Another section contains more information about freediving disciplines in open water and in a pool.\nArticle First Published 2023\nAnother Snorkeling Death in Hawaii\nA honeymoon is usually a time for celebration. But, the event turned into an absolute tragedy for a couple from California.\nThe groom drowned while snorkeling, according to reports on the GoFundMe fundraising platform. It got worse. Thieves also stole their rental car and personal belongings.\nWitnesses said they saw a man being pulled in from the surf after what looked like a bad snorkeling accident. He was lying lifeless on the sand at Electric Beach, a stunning location on the Westside of Oahu.\nThe victim received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) before medical services transported him to a local hospital - where he later died.\nImportant : The recent Snorkel Safety Study contains a final report with conclusions about Rapid Onset Pulmonary Edema in snorkeling (ROPE) and there's a free PDF download option.\nArticle First Published 2023\nSnorkeler in the 'Wrong Place at the Wrong Time'\nSo, this guy was enjoying a snorkeling session with his wife and friends at the Sir Charles Hardy Islands, off north-eastern Australia. Then, out of the blue came a saltwater crocodile that wrapped its jaws around the guy's head.\nNot only did he survive this terrifying ordeal, he responded to reporters by saying \"I was simply in the wrong place, at the wrong time.\"\nHe thought it was a big shark. But, he soon realised that the aggressor was in fact a crocodile. He levered open its jaws far enough to get his head out. He was taken to a nearby hospital where he received treatment for his injuries.\nNote : Check out our snorkeling and swimming bloggers section for equipment reviews, newsworthy articles, and tips on where to find great shallow water destinations.\nArticle First Published 2023\nFull Face Snorkel Mask Deaths Linked to IPO\nAssistant coroner 'Caroline Topping' from Surrey in the United Kingdom issued a public warning for snorkelers who use full-face masks.\nThe alert follows the verdict at an inquest held back in December 2022 into the sad death of a 63-year-old experienced snorkeller who died in Hurghada, Egypt (Angela Kearn).\nRescuers brought her back to the beach after noticing she was having some difficulty in the water.\nBut, she died later in hospital where the authorities stated the cause of death as being IPO (immersion pulmonary oedema).\nThe official records also showed she had been snorkeling with a Decathlon Easybreath mask (pictured).\nSo, What are the Common Causes of Lung Oedemas?\nIn simple terms, an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure can build up fluid in the lungs. In most cases, the increased water pressure causes the IPO after submerging the chest below the surface.\nIn this particular tragedy, hypertension , and Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) seemed to have exacerbated the condition.\nPlus, the full-face snorkel mask contributed to the death due to the negative pressure in the lungs (e.g. increased effort of breathing through a snorkel tube and mask).\nThe medical investigation aimed to determine whether breathing through different types of snorkel masks may lead to the inhalation of excessive CO2.\nIn conclusion, experts 'strongly recommend' not using the Easybreath if you have underlying cardio-respiratory conditions. A 'prevention of future deaths' report has since been submitted to all of the following:\nGeneral Medical Council\nNational Trading Standards\nRoyal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA)\nDecathlon UK\nAs a result, anyone who uses a full-face snorkel mask should be aware that snorkeling with ongoing cardiovascular and respiratory issues may create additional dangers.\nImportant : Acute lung edema can occur in surface swimming if pulmonary capillary permeability increases due to damage of the alveolar-capillary interface (known as 'non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema'). Another section explains more about immersion pulmonary edema including the common symptoms (e.g. coughing, sometimes with bloody sputum) and how to provide emergency medical treatment to IPO victims.\nMan Dies after Snorkeling at Alligator Reef in Florida\nThe Monroe County Sheriff's Office announced the death of a 61-year-old male after he had been snorkeling with Sundance Watersports at the Florida Keys.\nLocal reports say he had been in the water at Alligator Reef off Islamorada and he called for help around two o'clock in the afternoon.\nRescuers brought him back to the boat and got him out of the water. The crew started performing CPR as the boat made its way back to the shore.\nSadly, he was pronounced dead by the Mariners Hospital in Tavernier. At this time, it's unclear why the deceased signaled for help and the authorities are waiting for the autopsy results to establish a cause of death.\nOur snorkeler's blog reviews the new artificial snorkeling reef set for installation at Casino Beach, Pensacola, Florida.\nNote : Another section has more information about diving accidents and incidents and how we can learn from the misfortunes of others.\nArticle First Published 2023\nTourist Drowns while Snorkeling at Krabi Province\nLocal news reports stated that a 36 year old Taiwanese tourist had drowned near Hong Island, one of the popular dive sites in Krabi , Thailand.\nIt appears the victim was looking at the colourful coral reefs while breathing through a snorkel tube at the surface.\nWhen the lifeguards realised that he was lying face down in the water for too long, they brought the unconscious victim to the shore.\nThey performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) , and some reports say he regained a level of consciousness. But, tragically he died later at Krabi hospital.\nNote : Check out our section that contains advice about snorkeling for non swimmers - and how to use the correct techniques and equipment to stay afloat.\nArticle First Published 2023\nCouple Celebrate Valentine's Day with Record-Breaking Underwater Kiss\nA loving couple found a unique way to mark Valentine's Day this year. They broke the world record for the longest underwater kiss.\nGuinness World Records confirmed the achievement after the loved-up couple smooched for four (4) minutes and six (6) seconds below the surface in an infinity pool in the Maldives.\nThe previous record for continuous kissing underwater was three (3) minutes and twenty four (24) seconds (set 13 years ago).\nNote : Check out our freediving for beginners section with information about certification courses, equipment, and competitive disciplines.\nArticle First Published 2023\nSnorkeling Boat Capsizes in Watamu\nPreliminary reports about the incident suggest that strong storms hit the boat as it traveled along the Indian Ocean on Saturday the 21st of January.\nNews reports say three (3) people are known to have drowned and many more are missing. One of the local eyewitnesses told the press there were fifteen (15) Italians and at least ten (10) Kenyan nationals on board when it capsized.\nTo enhance safety, the government banned swimming and other activities (e.g. snorkeling tours ) at the beach after 5:30 pm back in December 2022.\nImportant : Besides cracking down on unseaworthy boats, stricter regulations to make everyone on board wear floating vests would help to reduce deaths such as these.\nArticle First Published 2023\nTravel and Vacation Items\nNew Shipwreck Site for Scuba Diving in Karnataka\nThe Kadali Beach Tourism Development has started preparing a shipwreck site close to Panambur Beach, near Karnataka on the southwest coast of India.\nAfter conducting a safety survey of the wreckage, it seems the picturesque setting could become a major attraction for local scuba divers.\nThe site is around 130 kilometres south of one of India's most popular destinations for divers and snorkelers - a heart-shaped coral island called Netrani.\nPro Tip : Check out another section that lists the best scuba diving in India , including the sites at Netrani Island.\nArticle First Published 2023\nWarning: Do Not Touch Marine Life in Thailand\nThai authorities have warned scuba divers about making contact with marine life. In fact, \"touching or possessing ornamental fish without permission\" is a criminal offence in Thailand.\nThe stern reminder follows the deportation of a Hungarian scuba diver in 2020 for the inappropriate interaction with marine life in Ko Pha Ngan.\nAlleged footage posted on YouTube shows a diver making contact with a pipefish (Trachyrhamphus bicoarctatus). It is now part of an ongoing process, with further charges pending.\nNote : We cover the topic of passive interaction with aquatic life in more detail in another section and why divers should only take photographs and memories.\nSimilan Island Closed for Monsoon Season\nLocated in the Phang Nga Province of Thailand, Similan is best known for the stunning coral reefs, colourful fishes, and pristine sandy beaches.\nDuring the worst of the monsoon season, the Similans shut down from the 16th of May to the 15th of October (2023). A seasonal closure helps to facilitate the restoration of the natural environment around the islands.\nNote : Another section contains information about the best Similan dive sites and why the location draws scuba diving and snorkeling enthusiasts to the area every year.\nBritish Woman Dies while Scuba Diving in Tenerife\nSpanish police confirmed the nationality of a scuba diver who died off a beach in Fasnia municipality as a 63 year old British lady.\nAs the investigation gets underway, there are no confirmed reports of any suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.\nNote : Our scuba database of scuba diving accidents stories and DAN incident reports contains more information about diving fatalities.\nArticle First Published 2023\n1980s Bomb Removed from Popular Dive Site\nAn unexploded bomb lay dormant at one of the popular Australian dive sites for over forty years.

The experience is one that simply cannot be found anywhere else as it combines diving and beautiful marine life with history and archaeology.\nOf course, almost every diver embarking on a wreck dive hopes that they will find some sort of hidden treasure or artefact not yet discovered but there is nothing quite like floating through a submerged wreck, particularly when it has become a new habitat for the marine life.\nWreck diving is awesome and many divers love it\nPhoto Credit: alfonsator\nWhy Wreck Diving Is So Great?\nWreck diving really allows you to submerge yourself – quite literally – into the history of the wrecks you are looking at.  Each of them has a story to tell and sometimes it can be a very tragic one.  Most divers feel an incredible sense of awe and respect when they dive wrecks and many remember the dives for ever. \nIt is likely that quite a number of people lost their lives when the wreck sunk, and this is something that you can almost feel in the atmosphere. That is Why for so many wreck diving is so spectaculair.\nAnother reason why wreck diving is so great is that it can be quite a challenging dive especially for beginners who have never taken part in this type of diving before. Of course, because of these challenges, wreck diving has its dangers and it is always advisable to dive with someone who knows the wreck and take additional training prior to the dive. \nSome of the dangers that most commonly lead to accidents are\nGetting lost\nA dive light failing leaving the divers submerged in darkness\nCarelessness leading to injury due to parts of the wreck being broken off\nIt is very important to remember that larger wrecks in particular will be pitch black inside, and if you have no light with you, you will be completely disorientated.  Also, with larger wrecks, such as ocean cruisers for example, you may get lost in the different parts of the ship, many divers choose to use rope to prevent this from happening. \nAlso read: Why do Diving Accidents Happen and How You Can avoid Them\nFeel free to check out our Scuba Dive partners on the map below for packages, training or guided trips:\nThis article is published by The Scuba Page, the online magazine for Scuba Dive lovers around the world.

But, we can also learn from the misfortunes of others and prevent the repetition of similar scenarios.\nThe factual reports and genuine case studies in this section highlight the tragedies of recent scuba diving accidents and incidents with critical insights to help change future outcomes.\nDiving Incident Database: Case Summaries\nThe Divers Alert Network ( DAN ) has been maintaining a comprehensive database of diving incidents since 1989.\nTo begin with, they limited the collection of factual records to accidents and incidents that involved scuba divers.\nCurrently, DAN's scuba diving accident and incident reports encompass genuine documentation and chronicles about:\nOpen-circuit scuba\nBreath-hold (e.g. freediving )\nRebreathers\nThe DAN Annual Diving Reports include a vital collection of published analysis. They release the insights and expert conclusions for the benefit of those involved in the scuba diving community.\nFurthermore, the featured commentaries and summaries are expressed by professionals in their field. So, divers of all experience levels can use the information to improve their risk management skills and identify safe scuba diving practices.\nNote : The main section contains recent news stories about scuba diving and snorkeling activities from around the world, listed chronologically.\nInterrupted Decompression Ends in DCS\nMost sport divers have a good chance of avoiding decompression injuries even if they miss a recommended safety stop.\nBut, surfacing before mandatory decompression stops have been completed means the likelihood of getting bent (decompression sickness) increases \"significantly\".\nCircumstances\nA buddy pair was conducting a mandatory 3-metre decompression stop on 100% oxygen. But, before they had fully decompressed, they became separated and one of the divers decided to abort the decompression obligation.\nThe diver determined that their dive buddy had already surfaced safely. So, they went back in the water to resume the decompression at six metres (20 feet). This is when the diver started to feel \"general malaise\" and nauseated.\nThen...\nAfter switching gases to EAN32, and descending to seven metres (23 feet), the diver started feeling better (according to the incident report).\nA few minutes later, the diver completed the 100% oxygen decompression at four metres (13 feet) with no notable problems.\nWithin 12 hours of surfacing...\nThe diver experienced the classic symptoms of decompression sickness (DCS), including discomfort in the torso, mild chest pain, and paresthesia (abnormal \"pins and needles\"). The health status worsened and the diver went to a local emergency room.\nAfter contacting the DAN emergency hotline number , they referred the patient to a recompression facility where they prescribed a USN TT6 (with extensions). The treatment was mostly successful, and the diver regained some mobility shortly afterward.\nWhat Did We Learn Here?\nAnyone who scuba dives should consider the omission of a decompression obligation as being a \"significant risk factor\" for decompression sickness - and plan accordingly.\nIt's fair to say that buddy separation happens. Nonetheless, part of pre dive safety planning should involve the prevention of, and procedures for, lost buddy situations.\nIn Conclusion\nDivers must take all measures to avoid interrupting a mandatory decompression. Barometric change during this stage of the dive can lead to enhanced bubble formation.\nApply any corrections prescribed by the training agency if a decompression obligation is not completed as planned. It's also wise to administer normobaric oxygen and keep the diver under observation for several hours after surfacing.\nPro Tip : Another section outlines the guidelines for decompression stop diving and what can happen after omitted decompression.\nDropped Weight Belt Causes Runaway Ascent\nCircumstances\nA diver was nearing the end of a dive at a depth of six (6) metres (20 feet). Without any obvious warning, the buckle came loose from the strap and the diver's weight belt fell off.\nThey exhaled and dumped air from the dry suit without delay. The stricken diver also tried to increase drag by flaring their body.\nThe dive buddy grabbed the ascending diver to try and slow them down. But, the runaway ascent dragged him up as well.\nWhat happened next?\nThe pair surfaced and both of them used the BCD power inflators to establish buoyancy. One of the other divers in the group retrieved the lost weight belt and brought it back to the boat.\nWhat Did We Learn Here?\nIf it happens \"unexpectedly\", a dropped weight belt can cause a rapid and uncontrolled ascent. But, there are several ways to minimise the severity of the situation.\nFor example :\nIn general, it's best not to put all the weights on a belt. So, you could put small diving weights in the rear pockets of a buoyancy control device (BCD) to spread out the total weights carried. This method also provides options to only drop a \"proportion\" of the weights in an emergency.\nLikewise, using a BCD with an integrated weight system means you can share the weights into rear pouches that can't drop off. Other weights could go on the weight belt or be strapped to the tank.\nMany drysuit divers use weight harness systems. This is another technique used to distribute the required number of weights around more than one location.\nIn Conclusion\nThe general rule of thumb in the diving community is to avoid putting too much solid lead on a single belt. Doing so can increase the tension on the buckle and make it more susceptible to open by itself.\nNonetheless, the diver attempted to spread out their body to increase drag and slow down the ascent. This is the recommended course of action to take and is likely to have prevented the incident from becoming a more severe one.\nPro Tip : Remember, the golden rule of scuba diving is to \"Never hold your breath\"! Rapid and uncontrolled ascents are a common reason why divers get arterial gas embolism (AGE).\nSafety Tips if Lightning Strikes the Dive Site\nAccording to statistics disclosed by the CDC, around 28 people die each year from lightning strikes in the United States. Furthermore, outdoor leisure activities account for 60% of lightning deaths.\nHere's an abridged account of what happened when some scuba divers got caught in a bad thunderstorm.\nCircumstances\nA group of experienced commercial divers were working underwater laying lines in a river. An unexpected flash of lightning struck the dive site while they were around six (6) metres underwater.\nThe divers experienced a discharge of electricity run through their limbs as they were holding some kind of conductive metal material.\nIncident Report\nThe report stated that lightning struck the actual dive site during the line laying operation. The divers were anchoring the line with a salvage lift bag and heavy metal disk brakes. They got hit with several electrical discharges.\nThey knew there would be a strong potential for scuba diving injuries . So, the divers stopped all activities and surfaced.\nHere's the important part :\nAfter contacting the Divers Alert Network (DAN) for professional guidance about lightning strike protocols when diving, they received a physical evaluation from a nearby medical center.\nThe hospital later released the divers and there were no 'significant' injuries reported. In fact, an official assessment from a doctor stated they received no immediate adverse effects even after being struck by lightning underwater.\nInsights and Review\nIt's fair to say that conducting scuba work during adverse weather should be avoided at all costs. It's also paramount to be familiar with the local weather patterns as part of any dive planning schedules.\nPlus, lightning can strike several miles away from the epicentre of a storm. In fact, records show that so-called \"bolts out of the blue\" can strike surface water up to fifteen (15) miles from dark storm clouds.\nThere's more...\nFor the most part, an electrical charge will dissipate (lose its energy) at depths around nine (9) metres (30 feet) below the surface. However, the conductive materials used by the divers most likely accounted for the electrical discharge running through the limbs.\nWhat Did We Learn Here?\nIf the weather looks the slightest bit inclement, you should avoid going scuba diving altogether. So, what if you get caught in the middle of a lightning storm while you're underwater?\nEnd the dive, exit the water without delay, and seek safe shelter.\nIf you can't swim to the surface in a safe manner, you should seek shelter around ten (10) metres out of any strong currents. Do not hold on to any metal objects (e.g. submerged metal shipwrecks ).\nExit the water following all scuba safety guidelines after the storm has passed.\nPro Tip : If you find yourself scuba diving in a thunderstorm, it is recommended that you seek a medical evaluation after exiting the water.\nShark Bites Spearfisher in Shallow Water\nMany of the recent scuba diving accidents share a common theme, such as low air, rapid ascent, or faulty equipment.\nBut, this particular underwater incident involves a freediving spear fisherman in a relatively shallow depth of water, and a blood-thirsty shark.\nCircumstances\nThe victim was spearing for fish in a body of water that was no deeper than eight metres (35 feet). He got lucky and started to reel in his catch while he was at the surface.\nThen, his luck changed when he was bitten on the shoulder by a shark. After being assisted onto the boat, the crew transferred him to a local hospital for a medical evaluation and treatment.\nIncident Reported to DAN\nThe official account of a freediving accident suggests the spear fisherman was kicking and splashing water at the surface after hooking into the fish.\nDespite making a 360 degree rotation to check for any danger, a shark came from behind and took a bite out of his shoulder.\nHere's the thing :\nThe incident report states the shark released its grip after the free diver struck it with some considerable force.\nOnce onboard, they applied a Combat Gauze® to reduce arterial bleeding during evacuation. The location of the bite site meant they were unable to apply a tourniquet.\nExpert's Review\nIt's fair to say splashing and kicking water near the surface would have alerted any large marine predators in the vicinity.\nPlus, delaying the removal of a speared fish from the water increases the risks associated with spearfishing near sharks . Large marine predators will respond to significant fish vibrations and bleeding animals in the water.\nAfter shooting a fish, the recommendation is to get help (e.g. from a buddy or boat crew) scanning for any large predators. This could be why the shark was able to attack unsighted from behind.\nWhat Did We Learn Here?\nAccording to the scuba diving fatality rate , free diving accidents are not common. Nonetheless, the use of spearfishing equipment increases the risk of attacks by some marine animals.\nEven though water splashing behaviour mimics injured prey, sharks are \"not\" the most dangerous animals for humans - not even close!\nThis is the important part :\nAnyone who is free diving with sharks should dive with a buddy. In addition, you should avoid spearfishing in water that has poor visibility. Try not to use a belt stringer or dive bag to carry dead or injured fish.\nWhat if you do use a belt stringer? If so, experts recommend cutting the gills or pith the brain of the fish to stop it vibrating. Sharks tend to sense vibrations faster than tiny droplets of blood.\nSometimes, administering a blunt blow to a shark's head or nose can repel its advances. These sensitive areas contain a high accumulation of sensory nerve fibres.\nUnless you have training - or some previous experience - experts do not recommend using weapons to try and kill a shark, such as knives, bang sticks, or the actual harpoon.\nPro Tip : If you're wondering... ' what is freediving ' we have another section with essential information for beginners.\nA Rapid Ascent to the Surface\nHave you ever experienced a runaway ascent? This diver did from around eighteen metres (60 feet). Even though she \"kept her cool\", things could have been much worse.\nCircumstances\nA sharp rap on the power inflator ( low pressure hose ) seemed to dislodge something that had caused the valve to stick open. Then, it got stuck again and the diver started another rapid uncontrolled ascent to the surface.\nShe tried to get the attention of the divers below by rapping on the inflator hose and banging on the scuba tank at the same time.\nIt got worse.\nThe buoyancy control jacket ( BCD ) filled with air and started to crush the diver's chest.\nThe jacket became tighter and the regulator was bringing in seawater. The classic symptoms of inhaling salt water can be dangerous for a diver.\nShe reached for the secondary regulator from her buddy and took in a breath. It's easy to forget in a moment of panic but she didn't purge it - which resulted in even more choking and coughing.\nHer buddy knew they were near the anchor line of the dive boat. So, he helped the stricken diver make a controlled ascent by raising both inflator hoses to let the air out.\nIn fact, the female diver was unconscious for most of the ascent. But, thanks to the calm actions of the dive buddy, both divers made it safely back to the boat.\nWhat Did We Learn Here?\nShe was treated for typical shock symptoms (rapid, weak pulse and confusion), and she received emergency oxygen on the dive boat.\nAfter being released from a hospital a few days later, it seems that the diver's panic-induced ascent caused a condition called 'cardiac demand ischemia'.\nSimply put, she suffered a heart attack underwater , but there were no signs of decompression sickness for either of the two divers.\nImportant lessons learned:\nAlways stay close to your dive buddy (close enough to reach using a single breath is good).\nPractice performing air-sharing techniques at regular intervals.\nPurge your buddy's alternate air source (octopus) before you use it.\nYou can also prepare for scuba diving emergencies by removing a simulated 'stuck power inflator' and still make your way to the surface.\nPro Tip : Even though recreational scuba has a 'relatively' low serious incident rate, divers who carry DAN dive accident insurance tend to breathe a little bit more \"relaxed\" underwater.\nBuford Sink Cave Diving Disaster\nBuford Springs Cave is a popular diving destination. But, local authorities had to investigate the deaths of two divers at the Chassahowitzka Wildlife Park, in Florida (around one hour north of Tampa).\nCircumstances\nTwo divers, thought to be in their late 50s, went diving inside the cavern using open circuit SCUBA (with 53 and 72 feet 3 aluminium tanks ).\nThey conducted two (2) dives in an overhead environment. One of the divers had already died when he surfaced during the second dive. The authorities found the second diver later near the permanent cave line at a depth of forty two (42) metres (137 feet).\nThe investigation confirmed that none of the divers had any gas remaining in their scuba cylinders.\nIncident Report Recorded by DAN\nAs the divers arrived at Buford Sink mid-morning, they chatted with a group of teenage swimmers while they set up the gear.\nThe first onset of a problem arose after they resurfaced from their first dive. That's when the teenagers overheard a discussion taking place between the two dive buddies .\nIt seemed they were trying to determine whether they had enough gas supply to make a second dive deep inside the cave.\nIt gets worse :\nThe report says they also heard diver 'A' express concerns about a possible leak coming from his cylinder.\nNonetheless, the two divers submerged for the second dive around mid-day.\nShortly after, the group saw diver 'B' floating face down on top of the water.\nThey tried to get him out of the water when they failed to see any bubbles.\nIt became obvious that diver 'B' was not breathing. So, they notified the local law enforcement and pulled the lifeless body towards the dock. They were unable to completely extricate the diver from the water.\nRecovery of the victim, and thorough equipment analysis, took place by the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery ( IUCRR ).\nEquipment Configuration Analysis\nWhen they recovered the bodies of both divers, there was little to no gas in their cylinders. An examination of the SCUBA equipment found it to be functioning in the proper manner.\nThey found a slight leak on the diving cylinder of diver 'A' (where the yoke first stage regulator connects to the tank valve). A readjustment of the yoke stopped the leak.\nImportant : Another section explains how inexpensive Vindicator Safety Valve Handles can save lives and how to fit a new replacement assembly yourself.\nCave Diving Review\nScuba diving in overhead environments (e.g. caverns and caves ) requires the proper safety equipment and extensive training. The same also applies to depths beyond the standard recreational limit - 40 metres (130 feet). The large cave area at Buford Sink extends beyond 130 feet.\nDetermining the exact trigger that caused the accident on the second dive is difficult. Even so, planning to explore a site beyond their limits will have increased the likelihood of an unfavourable outcome.\nFurthermore, another contributing factor for this fatal accident could have been the failure in confirming the remaining gas reserves prior to making the second dive.\nThe investigation criticised the use of 53 feet 3 and 72 feet 3 dive tanks. In this case, they considered them as being too small (compared to the 'industry standard' of 80 feet 3 aluminium cylinders).\nIn fact, Submersible Pressure Gauges (SPGs) read pressure - not volume. Thus, it's possible that the divers did not realise how limited their gas supply was when they started the second dive.\nWhat Did We Learn Here?\nThere are several recommendations about this tragic dual diver death disaster that new cave divers can use for making improvements.\nEnrol in professional scuba courses that teach divers how to dive in overhead environments (caverns and caves).\nGet proper education and training in (all):\nAdequate gas planning\nDive equipment configuration\nScuba emergency procedures\nAll divers should respect the limitations of their training (especially in overhead environments and for making decompression stops ).\nEvery dive requires due diligence for gas planning and ensuring adequate reserves are available for sharing gas (e.g. in case of an emergency).\nBuddy teams should also agree on turn pressures and minimum gas reserves - before starting the dive!\nImportant : Being trained in emergency first aid means you're prepared to assist with medical care. Also, some dive operators will insist on you providing a statement for their incident report. DAN also asks for voluntary submissions of scuba accidents and incidents via their Diving Incident Reporting System (DIRS).\nInstructor Sentenced after Diver's Death\nCircumstances\nThe incident happened in 2018. A Tec Instructor conducted a rebreather course at Stoney Cove - a large flooded quarry in Leicester.\nEven though the instructor had serviced the victim's rebreather unit before he made the dive, the inquest that followed later revealed some 'significant failings'.\nThe divers descended into a section called 'The Sump'. The maximum depth in this area is 35 metres (115 feet). Yet, course standards for the training conducted dictated a maximum depth of 30 metres (98 feet).\nThe student received several alarms from the rebreather while the two divers were inside the sump. As a result, the diver should have used the 'bailout' and switched to standard open circuit equipment.\nHere's what happened next :\nSadly, the diver became unconscious before he could reach the surface. The instructor and his safety diver attempted to assist the victim, but all 3 divers spent three (3) minutes at the depth of 35 metres.\nUpon reaching the surface, the unconscious diver had already drowned...\nWhat Did We Learn Here?\nThe fatal scuba incident resulted in an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in the United Kingdom.\nFindings from the HSE investigation ruled that the Technical diving instructor was responsible for several errors and omissions, including:\nInadequately maintaining and checking the breathing apparatus of his student.\nFailing to stay close enough to monitor his student and his equipment underwater.\nContravening TDI rules for exceeding the maximum diving depths for repetitive dives.\nFailing to have a rescue diver with 'adequate qualifications' accompany the pair (instructor and the student) in the water.\nThe coroner for Leicester City and South Leicestershire found the failings from the instructor and his safety diver added significant risks to the dive and may have caused, or contributed, to the diver's death.\nIn February 2023, the instructor was ordered to pay £3,085 costs and undertake fifty (50) hours of unpaid work.\nImportant : This tragic incident, along with other diving deaths similar to this one, reminds us that there are several key reasons to get dive accident insurance - even though it's not a legal requirement in some countries.\nDiver's Mouthpiece Became Detached\nCircumstances\nA diver went diving for four (4) consecutive days. During the second dive of the fourth day the regulator mouthpiece became completely separated from the second stage of the primary regulator.\nScuba Incident Report\nThe diver was enjoying a diving liveaboard trip and experiencing near perfect conditions. The water was a balmy 29° Celsius (81 Fahrenheit) and the seas were calm during the four days of island hopping. There was almost no noticeable current.\nThe incident happened as the diver carried out the second dive of the fourth day.\nWithin ten minutes of being underwater, the mouthpiece became completely detached from the primary regulator (e.g. the plastic component of the second stage ).\nAfter a few nervous moments, the diver knew there was a problem as they saw the main part of their primary floating in the water in front of them.\nThe diver reported swallowing at least three gulps of sea water before switching to their backup regulator (called an octopus).\nAfter taking some recovery breaths they safely ended the dive.\nThe incident report states that the regulator set was less than two (2) years old. But, it seems the plastic zip tie that holds the mouthpiece in place came loose during one of the previous dives.\nProfessional Evaluation\nIn this situation, clear communication with dive buddies is vital. The diver handled the situation with some calmness and they called off the dive without delay to fix the issue.\nAll divers need to check their equipment before entering the water - including their regulator mouthpieces .\nIn fact, they could have continued breathing from the open section of the primary (without the plastic or rubber gum shield). But, deploying the scuba octopus backup regulator in scuba emergencies such as this was the better response.\nWhat Did We Learn Here?\nFirst, never underestimate the importance of having your diving equipment serviced prior to the start of a diving season. You can become a PADI® Equipment Specialist and save money by doing it yourself.\nIn general, the manufacturer's recommended frequency for servicing scuba regulators is once a year (or a set number of dives).\nSome divers choose to buy custom mouthpieces for their breathing equipment. If so, it's a simple task to exchange a standard piece for your chosen size and colour.\nBeginners tend to bite down too hard and loosen the connection. Thus, you must make sure you secure the mouthpiece in the proper manner - using a strong zip tie.\nFinally, dive gear should be streamlined and regulator hoses should be a comfortable length. Remember, if you are wearing scuba accessory add-ons , they can become loose if there is excessive twisting or tugging underwater.\nFlushing and Muscle Cramps while Freediving\nCircumstances\nAs per the activities offered on a charter vessel, three free divers took part in one of the introductory level freediving courses .\nThe group surfaced after completing the first dive to around eight (8) metres (24 feet). Then, one of the free-divers started cramping, feeling flushed, and noticed a sense of extreme fatigue.\nReporting the Incident\nOne of the group was middle-aged, healthy, and fit. This particular student complained about the problems to the instructor and an assisting diver.\nIn response, the instructor told the distressed student to rest on a float at the surface while they called for help from the crew on the boat.\nHere's the thing :\nThe captain of the vessel, and a divemaster , helped get the diver onto the boat. They removed the wetsuit, rinsed them with clean water, and provided some drinking water. The two divers went back into the water to work with other students.\nWhen they resurfaced, they found out that the distressed student was receiving emergency oxygen - out of caution. They alerted the emergency services and took the student to a local hospital.\nFollowing a medical investigation, the hospital discharged the diver stating there were no complications or residual symptoms.\nExpert Analysis\nIf your body uses more fluid than taken in, it usually results in dehydration. As a consequence of this, the body does not have enough water to perform its normal functions.\nIn fact, anyone of any age and any fitness level can become dehydrated. The risk factors increase if you fail to drink enough water during exercise or in a hot climate.\nSo, what should you do when diving in hot, humid weather? It is important to make sure you are properly hydrated. The situation exacerbates if you are wearing exposure protection (e.g. a drysuit or a wetsuit ).\nWhat Did We Learn Here?\nTo begin with, all scuba divers, snorkelers, and free divers should be familiar with the common symptoms of dehydration. They include:\nConfusion\nDizziness\nExtreme thirst\nFatigue\nFlushed skin\nMuscle cramps\nPart of dehydration treatment involves consuming clear liquids. The aim is to replenish the lost water. Even so, there can also be a need for serious interventions by medical personnel.\nAlways seek medical attention if the symptoms worsen. Nonetheless, proper hydration should begin several days before you go diving. It takes longer than you might think for the body to absorb water.\nDive boats in particular should make fresh drinking water and electrolytes available for divers. Plus, divers should also carry their own reusable water bottles so they can increase hydration through the day.\nPro Tip : Another section explains 'what is freediving' and 'how to freedive' , including what equipment you will use during the certification courses.\nAn Underwater Altercation\nCircumstances\nA fight occurred between a dive guide and another diver while they were underwater. Another dive group saw the event take place while they were conducting a drift dive in deep water.\nDiver's Incident Report\nIt was one of those beautiful days that we often dream about for a scuba dive. The group were undertaking a fun excursion with hopes of seeing a range of different sea-life species , and maybe a shark or two.\nAfter making a normal descent, two groups positioned themselves along the edge of the reef. Following on, the dive guide also found a suitable area to settle and promptly hooked into the reef.\nAs they looked up, they witnessed one of the divers swim over and, without any clear warning, punch the guide in the face.\nAfter the initial blow, they saw the attacker grab the guide and rip off their mask and regulator.\nUnsure of how to handle the situation they had just seen, the buddy pair decided to end the dive and ascend to the surface.\nIt appears the attacker continued with the underwater altercation and inflated the guide's buoyancy device - resulting in a rapid ascent. The guide responded by grabbing hold of the assailant and they both shot up together.\nHere's the thing :\nWhen everyone got back on the boat, no one seemed to have sustained any of the common scuba diving injuries . But, they did manage to establish a motive for the attack.\nThe dive guide had secured his place on the reef and communicated his intent to the rest of the group. But, the attacker seemed unhappy about it and got too close for comfort. A fight broke out after the dive guide pushed the other diver out of the way.\nExpert's Review\nScuba divers fighting underwater is not commonplace, but it happens! The diver who submitted a diving incident report to DAN also stated they were shocked by the severity of the brawl and not sure what they should do.\nOften, stress and nervous emotion are the root causes of underwater squabbles. Scuba diving is seen as a non-contact sport, and there is no room for violence in the industry.\nScuba diving accidents and incidents such as this one can easily end up having a fatal outcome. The divers who aborted their dive helped to reduce further escalation and the potential for a panicked response.\nWhat Did We Learn Here?\nSo, the question you may be asking is what should you do if someone attacks you underwater or you are the victim in a fight?\nIn simple terms, it is usually better to treat an aggressor as if they were a panicked diver (e.g. diversion tactics in scuba rescue training ).\nHow does that work?\nAnother section contains more information about diving emergencies and the best tow to use while wearing scuba gear. But, the following steps come from the skills you learn in the PADI® Rescue Diver course :\nWhenever possible, use physical force to try and push the attacker away from you.\nYou may also be able to duck down below them so you can get away from their clutch.\nAlways face the diver (do not turn your back on them).\nSignal for help as soon as possible using devices that make a noise underwater (e.g. a rattle, a tank banger).\nEnd the dive without delay and in a safe manner.\nSo, what should you do if you are witnessing scuba divers fighting underwater? It's best not to interfere or try to break up the fight.\nMost divers carry knives. Even though they may not be carrying the best diving knife available, situations like these can soon escalate.\nInstead, wait for the tussle to end and then you may be able to assist any victims. Plus, there may be lost equipment that you can retrieve in case there will be a legal investigation.\nOnce the confrontation has finished, you should consider whether you (and your buddy) are comfortable to continue with the dive. If not, go ahead and surface in the usual, safe manner. In some cases, it is ethical and prudent to inform the dive operator about any untoward events that you witnessed.\nImportant : Being trained in emergency first aid means you're prepared to assist with medical care. Also, some dive operators will insist on you providing a statement for their incident report. DAN also asks for voluntary submissions of scuba accidents and incidents via their Diving Incident Reporting System (DIRS).\nThe Nasty Taste of Caustic Cocktail\nCircumstances\nThis incident involved an assisted diver who was diving with friends and using a closed-circuit rebreather (CCR).\nThe question is... was poor communication with the boat crew to blame for a regular recreational tech dive to end badly?\nDiving Incident Report\nThe diver is a disabled veteran (who dives with assistance) and has a lot of experience with their CCR unit. But, the new crew on the vessel he was diving on were unfamiliar and untrained for handling this type of specialised equipment.\nAfter explaining their assistance requirements to the crew, the diver completed a pre-dive checklist and pre-breathe obligation.\nHere's where things went wrong :\nIt was clear the hoses were dragging along the boat when the new crew member handed the rebreather to the disabled diver in the water. Even so, he made the final checks and the group started their descent for the dive.\nOn the way down, at around ten metres, there were some obvious and abnormal breathing issues and they decided to end the dive. The diver who chose to make an incident report to DAN states they inhaled a bad case of caustic cocktail.\nAfter getting back onboard, the symptoms included not being able to talk for half an hour. They also had a burning throat, which lasted for a few days.\nDespite not seeking medical attention, the affected diver refrained from any scuba activities for the next six days. They also had their equipment serviced.\nEven though it looks like the hose came unattached at some point, it took a deep submersion for the hose to fill with water.\nProfessional Evaluation\nIt is important to pack rebreather units with a scrubber material , such as soda lime (a mixture of sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide). The scrubber material removes carbon dioxide from the diver's exhaled gas.\nBut, if a lot of water mixes with the scrubber material it produces a chemical reaction. In turn, this mixture creates concentrated caustic soda, often referred to as 'caustic cocktail'.\nIs it dangerous?\nCaustic soda can be dangerous if you inhale or ingest it (swallowing it can be fatal). That's why performing pre-dive checklists for rebreathers is an essential task.\nThere are several ways for water to enter the canister that houses the scrubbing material. But, some of the most common causes will be:\nDisconnection\nFailing to close the breathing loop\nLeakage\nEven though the rebreather diver reported carrying out a checklist before the dive, there was no mention about any untoward or abnormal findings in his records.\nNonetheless, calling the dive at the first hint of a problem avoided the need for emergency treatment or a worsening incident.\nWhat Did We Learn Here?\nThere are several ways to treat the ingestion of caustic soda. You should try to flush it with water as soon as possible. You can use seawater if you don't have access to freshwater.\nThe primary aim is to reduce the contact time for the caustic soda. So, flushing with freshwater also helps to dilute any residual solution.\nUnfortunately, not all crew members who work on dive charters are properly trained on how to handle scuba equipment. Even worse, very few boat staff have appropriate first aid training (e.g. a valid EFR Certification ).\nRelated Information and Help Guides\nBWRAF: The Pre Dive Checklist\nCommon Mistakes in Scuba Diving\nDAN Diver Alert Network\nPADI Emergency Action Plan\nScuba News: What Happened Today?\nImportant : Divers can report a scuba incident to DAN about a near miss or an event that caused personal injury.

The risks of dying during recreational , scientific or commercial diving are small, and on scuba , deaths are usually associated with poor gas management , poor buoyancy control , equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, though the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error on the part of the victim. [1] [2]\nEquipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba , and while the cause of death is commonly recorded as drowning , this is mainly the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events taking place in water. Arterial gas embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, and it, too, is the consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent , possibly aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. [3] There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases, the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research that could improve diver safety. [4]\nFor diving facilities, scuba diving fatalities have a major financial impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. [1]\nStatistics [ edit ]\nDiving fatality data published in Diving Medicine for Scuba Divers (2015) [3]\n90% died with their weight belt on.\n86% were alone when they died (either diving solo or separated from their buddy).\n50% did not inflate their buoyancy compensator.\n25% first got into difficulty on the surface\n50% died on the surface.\n10% were under training when they died.\n10% had been advised that they were medically unfit to dive .\n5% were cave diving .\n1% of divers attempting a rescue died as a result.\nFatality rates of 16.4 deaths per 100,000 persons per year among DAN America members and 14.4 deaths per 100,000 persons per year the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) members were similar and did not change during 2000–2006. This is comparable with jogging (13 deaths per 100,000 persons per year) and motor vehicle accidents (16 deaths per 100,000 persons per year), and within the range where reduction is desirable by Health and Safety Executive (HSE) criteria. [5]\nActivity-based statistics would be a more accurate measurement of risk. Noted above are statistics showing diving fatalities comparable to motor vehicle accidents of 16.4 per 100,000 divers and 16 per 100,000 drivers. DAN 2014/12/17 data shows there are 3.174 million divers in America. Their data shows that 2.351 million dive 1 to 7 times per year. 823,000 dive 8 or more times per year. It is reasonable to say that the average would be in the neighbourhood of 5 dives per year. [6]\nData for 17 million student-diver certifications during 63 million student dives over a 20-year period from 1989-2008 show a mean per capita death rate of 1.7 deaths per 100,000 student divers per year. This was lower than for insured DAN members during 2000–2006 at 16.4 deaths per 100,000 DAN members per year, but fatality rate per dive is a better measure of exposure risk, A mean annual fatality rate of 0.48 deaths per 100,000 student dives per year and 0.54 deaths per 100,000 BSAC dives per year and 1.03 deaths per 100,000 non-BSAC dives per year during 2007. The total size of the diving population is important for determining overall fatality rates, and the population estimates from the 1990s of several million U.S. divers need to be updated. [5]\nDuring 2006 to 2015 there were an estimated 306 million recreational dives made by US residents and 563 recreational diving deaths from this population. The fatality rate was 1.8 per million recreational dives, and 47 deaths for every 1000 emergency department presentations for scuba injuries. [7]\nThe most frequent known root cause for diving fatalities is running out of, or low on, breathing gas, but the reasons for this are not specified, probably due to lack of data. Other factors cited include buoyancy control, entanglement or entrapment, rough water, equipment misuse or problems and emergency ascent . The most common injuries and causes of death were drowning or asphyxia due to inhalation of water, air embolism and cardiac events. Risk of cardiac arrest is greater for older divers, and greater for men than women, although the risks are equal by age 65. [5]\nSeveral plausible opinions have been put forward but have not yet been empirically validated. Suggested contributing factors included inexperience, infrequent diving, inadequate supervision, insufficient predive briefings, buddy separation and dive conditions beyond the diver's training, experience or physical capacity. [5]\nAnnual fatalities [ edit ]\nThis section needs expansion with: data from other years and other geographical regions. You can help by adding to it . ( October 2023 )\nDAN was notified of 561 recreational scuba deaths during 2010 to 2013. 334 were actively investigated by DAN [8]\nDAN was notified of 146 recreational scuba deaths during 2014. 68 were actively investigated by DAN [9]\nDAN was notified of 127 recreational scuba deaths during 2015. 67 were actively investigated by DAN [10]\nDAN was notified of 169 recreational scuba deaths during 2016. 94 were actively investigated by DAN [11]\nDAN was notified of 228 recreational scuba deaths during 2017. 70 were actively investigated by DAN [12]\nDAN was notified of 189 recreational scuba deaths during 2018. [13]\nCause of death [ edit ]\nSee also: Investigation of diving accidents § Causes of diving accidents\nAccording to death certificates, over 80% of the deaths were ultimately attributed to drowning, but other factors usually combined to incapacitate the diver in a sequence of events culminating in drowning, which is more a consequence of the medium in which the accidents occurred than the actual accident. Often the drowning obscures the real cause of death . Scuba divers should not drown unless there are other contributory factors as they carry a supply of breathing gas and equipment designed to provide the gas on demand. Drowning occurs as a consequence of preceding problems, such as cardiac disease, pulmonary barotrauma, unmanageable stress , unconsciousness from any cause, water aspiration, trauma , equipment difficulties, environmental hazards, inappropriate response to an emergency or failure to manage the gas supply. [3]\nThe data gathered in relation to the actual causes of death is changing. Although drowning and arterial gas embolisms are cited in the top three causes of diver deaths, stating these as solitary causes does not recognise any pre-existing health issues. Researchers may know the actual causes of death, but the sequence of events that led to the cause of death is often not clear, especially when local officials or pathologists make assumptions. [14]\nIn many diving destinations , resources are not available for comprehensive investigations or complete autopsies , The 2010 DAN Diving Fatalities workshop noted that listing drowning as a cause of death is ineffective in determining what actually occurred in an incident, and that lack of information is the primary reason for personal injury lawsuits filed in the industry. [14]\nA DAN study published in 2008 investigated 947 recreational open-circuit scuba diving deaths from 1992–2003, and where sufficient information was available, classified the incidents in terms of a sequence of trigger, disabling agent, disabling injury and cause of death. Insufficient gas was the most frequent trigger, at 41%, followed by entrapment at 20%, and equipment problems at 15%. The most common identifiable disabling agents were emergency ascents, at 55%, followed by insufficient gas at 27% and buoyancy complications at 13%. The most frequent disabling injuries were asphyxia at 33%, arterial gas embolism at 29% and cardiac incidents at 26%. Cause of death was reported as drowning in 70% of the cases, arterial gas embolism in 14% and cardiac arrest in 13%. The investigator concluded that disabling injuries were more relevant than cause of death, as drowning often occurred as a consequence of a disabling injury. A further analysis linked risk of type of disabling injury with trigger events. Asphyxia followed entrapment (40%), insufficient gas (32%), buoyancy problems (17%), equipment problems (15%), rough water (11%). Arterial gas embolism was associated with emergency ascent (96%), insufficient gas (63%), equipment trouble (17%), entrapment (9%). Cardiac incidents were associated with cardiovascular disease and age over 40 years. Their conclusion was that the most effective way to reduce diving deaths would be by minimising the frequency of adverse events. [4]\nManner of death [ edit ]\nIf the manner of death is deemed to be accidental (or due to misadventure, where this is applicable), which is usually the case, the incident leading to death is seldom analysed sufficiently to be useful in determining the probable sequence of events, particularly the triggering event, and therefore is not usually useful for improving diver safety. [1] [14]\nThe chain of events leading to diving fatalities is varied in detail, but there are common elements: a triggering event, which leads to a disabling or harmful event and causes a disabling injury, which may itself be fatal or lead to drowning. One or more of the four events may not be unidentifiable. [14]\nDeath usually followed a sequence or combination of events, most of which may have been survivable in isolation. In the more than 940 fatality statistics studied by DAN over ten years, only one-third of the triggers could be identified. The most common of these were: [1] [14]\nInsufficient gas (41%)\nEntrapment (20%)\nEquipment problems (15%)\nDisabling agents were also identified in one-third of the cases. The most common identified were: [1]\nEmergency ascent (55%)\nInsufficient gas (27%)\nBuoyancy trouble (13%)\nDisabling injuries [ edit ]\nDisabling injuries were identified in nearly two-thirds of the cases. [1] The criteria for identify the disabling injury by forensic judgement are specified. [4]\nAsphyxia (33%), with or without aspiration of water, and no evidence of a previous disabling injury.\nTriggering events associated with asphyxia included: [4]\n(40%) entrapment due to entanglement in kelp , wreckage, mooring lines, fishing lines or nets, and entrapment in confined spaces or under ice\n(32%) insufficient gas, when it was the first identifiable problem, but generally the reason for lack of gas was not determined.\n(15%) problems with equipment included regulator free-flow, unexpectedly high gas consumption, and diver error in the use of the scuba apparatus, buoyancy compensator, weighting system or dry suit.\n(11%) rough water conditions included high sea states, strong currents, and surf conditions at beaches, rocky shores and piers.\nDisabling agents associated with asphyxia cases included: [4]\n(62%) insufficient gas, triggered by entrapment, equipment problems, or high gas consumption due to heavy exercise in rough conditions.\n(17%) buoyancy problems, triggered by over- or under-weighting, lack of inflation gas for the buoyancy compensator, or over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit.\n(13%) emergency ascent, triggered by entrapment or lack of breathing gas, was associated with both asphyxia and lung overpressure injury.\nOther contributing factors were not as clearly connected: Panic was reported in about a fifth of the cases, and may have caused aspiration or accelerated gas consumption. Casualties were diving alone or were separated from their buddies in about 40% of cases with asphyxia, but this was also associated with other disabling injuries.\nArterial gas embolism (29%), with gas detected in cerebral arteries, evidence of lung rupture, and history of an emergency ascent.\nTriggers associated with AGE included: [4]\n(63%) insufficient gas,\n(17%) equipment problems,\n(9%) entanglement or entrapment\nAGE deaths were often associated with panic.\nDisabling agents associated with AGE cases included: [4]\n(96%) emergency ascent. Loss of consciousness was typical, followed by drowning for divers who remained in the water after surfacing.\nCardiac incidents (26%), where chest discomfort was indicated by the diver, distress displayed with no obvious cause, a history of cardiac disease and autopsy evidence.\nThere were few overt triggers or disabling agents identified, but reports suggested that about 60% of the decedents displayed symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain or other distress, and 10% displayed these symptoms before the dive.\nProblems were noticed before entering the water in 24% of these cases, at the bottom in 46% of cases, and after starting the ascent in 20% of cases\nLoss of consciousness could occur at any time.\nAutopsy reports usually showed evidence of significant cardiovascular disease but seldom myocardial damage, which suggests that fatal dysrhythmias or drowning may have occurred before heart muscle injury could develop.\nDisabling cardiac incidents were associated with cardiovascular disease and age greater than 40 years, but no significant association with body mass index. [4]\nTrauma (5%), where a traumatic incident was witnessed or determined by autopsy. The cause of injury is usually obvious, and included incidents of being struck by a watercraft, tumbled over a rocky shoreline by surf, electric shock, and interactions with marine animals. Some could possibly have been avoided by the diver. Traumatic injuries were most commonly associated with rough water conditions and being a frequent diver. [4]\nDecompression sickness (3.5%), based on symptoms, signs and autopsy findings. Triggers for DCS included: [4]\ninsufficient gas, followed by emergency ascent with omitted decompression.\nmultiple repetitive dives with short surface intervals.\ngas lost in a regulator free-flow\nuncontrolled ascent due to dry suit inflator malfunction\ndragged deep by a speared fish\nDCS was associated with deep diving, diving alone, and emergency ascent with omitted decompression\nUnexplained loss of consciousness (2.5%), where the diver was discovered unconscious without obvious cause. [4]\nTriggers may have included deep dives, diabetes and nitrox dives, including a seizure witnessed at a depth where the oxygen partial pressure would have been approximately 1 bar, normally considered safe.\nLoss of consciousness was associated with diabetes, frequent diving, and learner divers.\nInappropriate gas (2%), Breathing gas supply contaminated by toxic levels of carbon monoxide, or selection of gas with excessive or insufficient oxygen content for the depth. [4]\nCNS oxygen toxicity, in some cases associated with medications.\nCarbon monoxide poisoning from contaminated cylinder gas\nHypoxia, from incorrect gas choice and from oxygen content depleted by corrosion in the cylinder\nAssociation and causality [ edit ]\nThe traditional procedure for developing diving safety recommendations is based on the assumption that associations of circumstances with fatalities are causative. This is reasonable in cases where the cause both precedes the effect and is logically clearly connected, such as where entanglement precedes asphyxia, but in many cases indirect associations are not clearly causative and require further verification. This may not be possible when there is insufficient data. Confident causal inference requires consistent associations that do not conflict with logical medical and engineering reasoning. [4]\nAnalysis of case information for diving fatalities has identified a wide variety of triggers and disabling agents, but has also shown that most fatalities are associated with a small group of these triggers and disabling agents, which suggests that a large reduction in fatalities could be achieved by concentrating on remedying these key factors. Many of these could be improved by training and practice, some by a change of attitude, but some diving fatalities appear to be unavoidable as the risk is inherent in the activity and depends on factors that are not under the control of the diver. [4]\nThe most frequent trigger appears to be insufficient breathing gas. This can obviously be avoided by paying more attention to gas management and having a reliable emergency gas supply available. The next most frequent trigger, entanglement, can largely be avoided by keeping clear of obvious entanglement hazards, and can be mitigated by extrication skills, tools and an adequate gas supply while busy. A competent buddy is clearly of great value in cases where the diver cannot see or reach the snag point. The third ranking trigger was equipment failure, but the variety of failures possible is large, and diving equipment in good condition is generally very reliable. No particular item appears to be obviously less reliable. Good maintenance, testing of function before use, carrying redundant critical equipment and skill at correcting the more critical malfunctions are fairly obvious remedies. [4]\nThe most frequent disabling agent in response to a trigger appears to be emergency ascent. Clearly, avoiding the trigger would eliminate the disabling agent, and this should be the top priority, but the ability to cope effectively with an emergency that does occur would break the sequence of uncontrolled and harmful events, and probably avoid a fatality. A fully independent alternate air source or a fully competent and reliable buddy are the obvious solutions, as more than half of the victims were on their own preceding death. [4]\nInappropriate buoyancy was the most frequently identified adverse event, with negative buoyancy more common than positive buoyancy. On some occasions the buoyancy problem was sudden and control was lost quickly, but on many occasions there was a longer term effect of non-catastrophic but chronic over-weighting which led to overexertion and rapid gas consumption, leaving the diver less capable of coping with the stress of the next problem to occur. Buoyancy issues could be a more important contributing factor than is immediately apparent. [4]\nContributory factors [ edit ]\nThe \"DAN Annual Diving Report 2016 edition\" lists their Ten Most Wanted Improvements in Scuba as: [9] : 5 \nCorrect weighting\nGreater buoyancy control\nMore attention to gas planning\nBetter ascent rate control\nIncreased use of checklists\nFewer equalizing injuries\nImproved cardiovascular health in divers\nDiving more often (or more pre-trip refresher training)\nGreater attention to diving within limits\nFewer equipment issues / improved maintenance\nDiving techniques, competence, and experience [ edit ]\nMore than half of diving fatalities may be a consequence of violations of accepted good practice. Divers who died for reasons other than a medical cause were found to be about 7 times more likely to have one or more violations of recommended practice associated with the fatality. [2]\nThe DAN fatalities workshop of 2011 found that there is a real problem that divers do not follow the procedures they have been trained in, and dive significantly beyond their training, experience, and fitness levels, and that this was the basic cause of most accidents. In litigation involving diving accidents, the legal panel reported that 85% to 90% of the cases were attributable to diver error. This is consistent with several scientific studies. Medical issues are a significant part of the problem, and certified divers are responsible for assessing their own fitness and ability to do any particular dive. Experience was also cited as a significant factor, with occasional divers at higher risk than regular divers, and the majority of fatalities had only entry level or slightly higher qualification (\" Advanced open-water diver \" certification is included in this grouping). [1]\nA large percentage (40 to 60%) of deaths in the Edmonds summary were associated with panic, a psychological reaction to stress which is characterized by irrational and unhelpful behaviour, which reduces the chances of survival. Panic typically occurs when a susceptible diver is in a threatening and unfamiliar situation, such as running out of breathing gas, or loss of ability to control depth, and is commonly complicated by inappropriate response to the triggering situation, which generally makes the situation worse. Evidence of panic is derived from behavioural reports from eyewitnesses. [3]\nInadequate gas supply [ edit ]\nThe ANZ survey found in 56% of fatalities and the DAN survey in 41%, that the diver was either running low or was out of breathing gas . When equipment was tested following death, few victims had an ample gas supply remaining. The surveys indicated that most problems started when the diver became aware of a low on air situation. 8% of the divers died while trying to snorkel on the surface, apparently trying to conserve air. Concern about a shortage of air may affect the diver's ability to cope with a second problem which may develop during the dive, or may cause the diver to surface early and possibly alone in a stressed state of mind, where he is then unable to cope with surface conditions. [3]\nBuoyancy problems [ edit ]\nIn the ANZ survey, 52% of the fatalities had buoyancy problems. Most of these were due to inadequate buoyancy, but 8% had excessive buoyancy. In the DAN survey buoyancy problems were the most common trigger event leading to death. Buoyancy changes associated with wetsuits were found to be a significant factor. Based on a formula for approximate weight requirement based on wetsuit style and thickness, 40% of the divers who died were found to be grossly over-weighted at the surface. This would have been aggravated by suit compression at depth. [3]\nA correctly weighted diver should be neutrally buoyant at or near the surface with cylinders nearly empty. In this state, descent and ascent are equally easy. This requires the diver to be slightly negative at the start of the dive, due to the weight of the gas in the full cylinders, but this and the buoyancy loss due to suit compression should be easily compensated by partial inflation of the buoyancy compensator. The practice of over-weighting is dangerous at it may overwhelm the capacity of the buoyancy compensator and makes the buoyancy changes with depth more extreme and difficult to correct. A failure of the buoyancy compensator would be exacerbated. This dangerous practice is unfortunately promoted by some instructors as it expedites shallow water training and allows divers to learn to descend without fully learning the appropriate skills. [3] Greater skill is required to dive safely with more weight than is necessary, but no amount of skill can compensate for insufficient weighting during decompression stops. On dives where decompression is planned, competent divers will often carry a bit more weight than strictly necessary to ensure that in a situation where they have lost or used up all their gas and are relying on a supply from a team member, they do not have to struggle to stay down at the correct stop depth. Some divers may be unaware of the need to adjust weight to suit any change in equipment that may affect buoyancy, due to inadequate training. Some dive shops do not provide facilities for the diver to adjust weighting to suit the combined equipment when renting a full set of gear to someone who has not used that combination before, and just add a few weights to ensure the diver can get down at the start of the dive.\nIn a survey on buddy diver fatality it was found that regardless of who was first to be low on air, the over-weighted diver was six times more likely to die. [3]\nIn spite of being heavily reliant on their buoyancy compensators, many divers also misused them. Examples of this include accidental inflation or over-inflation causing rapid uncontrolled ascents, confusion between the inflation and dump valves, and inadequate or slow inflation due to being deep or low on air. The drag caused by a buoyancy compensator inflated to offset the weight belt can contribute to exhaustion in divers attempting to swim to safety on the surface. The American Academy of Underwater Sciences reported in 1989 that half the cases of decompression sickness were related to loss of buoyancy control. [3] When twin-bladder buoyancy compensators are used, confusion as to how much gas is in each bladder can lead to a delay in appropriate response, by which time control of the ascent may have already been lost.\nFailure to ditch weights [ edit ]\n90% of the fatalities did not ditch their weights. Those on the surface had to swim towards safety carrying several kilograms of unnecessary weight, which made staying at the surface more difficult than it needed to be. In some fatalities the weights had been released but became entangled. In other cases, the belt could not be released because it was worn under other equipment, or the release buckle was inaccessible because a weight had slid over it, or it had rotated to the back of the body. Other fatalities have occurred where release mechanisms have failed. [3]\nBuddy system failures [ edit ]\nIn spite of the general acceptance, teaching and recommendation of the buddy system by most, if not all diver certification organisations, only 14% of divers who died still had their buddy with them at the time. In a Hawaiian study 19% of the fatalities died with their buddy present. In the ANZ study 33% of the fatalities either dived alone or voluntarily separated from their buddies before the incident, 25% separated after a problem developed and 20% were separated by the problem. In the DAN study, 57% of those who started diving with a buddy were separated at the time of death. [3]\nThe buddy is primarily there to assist when things go wrong to the extent that the diver cannot cope alone, and the absence of a buddy is not in itself a threat to life. Buddy separation cannot be a cause of death, it is simply a failure of an engineering redundancy, leaving the diver without backup in case of specific emergencies, and the appropriate response is to abort the dive, as for any other failure of a singly redundant safety critical item. However, unplanned buddy separation may imply that the missing buddy has already run into trouble beyond their capacity to resolve. A common cause of separation was one diver running low on air and leaving their buddy to continue the dive alone. In some cases more than two divers dived together, without adequate team planning, leading to confusion as to who was responsible for whom. Groups of divers following a dive leader without formal buddy pairing before the dive would be split into pairs to surface by the dive leader as they reached low air status. This would frequently pair the least experienced and competent divers for the ascent including those over-breathing due to anxiety. [3]\nIn others cases, the survivor was leading the victim and not immediately aware of the problem. It is common for the more experienced diver to lead, and also common for the follower not to remain in a position where he can easily be monitored, so the follower may only get intermittent attention and may be inconveniently situated when something goes wrong. By the time the lead diver notices the absence of the buddy it may be too late to assist. [3] Each buddy is responsible for ensuring that the other knows where they are at all times.\nBuddy rescue [ edit ]\nIn a minority of cases the buddy was present at the time of death. In 1% of cases the buddy died attempting rescue. [3] In at least one case the survivor had to forcibly retrieve their primary demand valve from a buddy who was apparently unwilling or unable to share it after the secondary demand valve was rejected during an assisted ascent. [10]\nBuddy breathing [ edit ]\n4% of fatalities were associated with failed buddy breathing . [3]\nIn a study of failed buddy breathing conducted by NUADC, more than half were attempted at depths greater than 20 metres. In 29% the victim's mask was displaced, and a lung over-pressure injury occurred in 12.5% of cases. One in 8 victims refused to return the demand valve , however, donating a regulator rarely results in the donor becoming the victim. The use of a secondary ( octopus regulator ) second stage or a completely separate emergency air supply ( bailout cylinder ) would appear to be a safer alternative. [3]\nPhysiological factors [ edit ]\nA survey of DAN America members during 2000 to 2006 indicated a low incidence of cardiac-related fatalities in divers less than 40 years old. The rates increased until about 50 years old and stabilised for older divers at a relative risk of approximately 13 times greater than for younger divers. Relative risk for older divers was also found to be greater for asphyxia (3.9 times) and arterial gas embolism (2.5 times). Relative risk between males and females reduced from about 6 to 1 at 25 years to even at 65 years. DAN Europe statistics follow a similar trend.\nThe victim had a pre-existing condition which would widely be considered a contraindication to diving in about 25% of fatalities. Some disorders have no demonstrable pathology and are easily overlooked in an investigation, which results in incomplete understanding of the incident. Drowning can obscure some pathologies which may then not show up at autopsy. [3]\nFatigue was a factor in a significant number of cases (28% according to Edmonds). Fatigue is caused by excessive exertion, is aggravated by physical unfitness, and reduces the reserves available for survival. Factors cited as causes of fatigue include excessive drag due to over-weighting, drag due to over-inflation of the BCD, and long surface swims in adverse sea conditions, and it was not restricted to unfit divers. Fatigue was also associated with salt-water aspiration syndrome , cardiac problems and asthma. [3]\nSalt water aspiration was a factor in 37% of cases in the Edmonds summary. This refers to inhalation of a small amount of sea water by the conscious diver, often in the form of spray. Salt water aspiration may be caused by a regulator leak, rough conditions on the surface, or residual water in the regulator after regulator recovery or buddy breathing. Salt water aspiration may cause respiratory distress, fatigue or panic and other complications. [3]\nAutopsy evidence of pulmonary barotrauma was found in 13% of the cases summarised by Edmonds et al. This was sometimes a complicating factor, but at other times the direct cause of death. Factors associated with pulmonary barotrauma include panic, rapid buoyant ascent, asthma and regulator failure. In half of these cases a cause for the barotrauma was identified, but a roughly equal number remain unexplained. [3]\nIn cases where the Edmonds summary found cardiac failure was implicated there was either gross cardiac pathology or a clinical indication of cardiac disease in the autopsy findings. 26% of deaths in the DAN studies were due to cardiac failure. 60% of these victims complained of chest pain, dyspnoea or feeling unwell before or during the dive. Cardiac causes are implicated in about 45% of scuba deaths in divers over 40 years old, and they tend to be relatively experienced divers, frequently with a history of cardiac disease or high blood pressure. The associated triggers include exercise, drugs, hypoxia from salt water aspiration, cardio-pulmonary reflexes, respiratory abnormalities, restrictive dive suits and harness, and cold exposure. [3]\nin at least 9% of fatalities in the ANZ survey cited by Edmonds et al. the diver was asthmatic, and in at least 8% of the cases asthma contributed to the death. In other surveys this correlation is not so clear. Surveys have shown that between 0.5% and 1% of recreational divers are asthmatics. Edmonds considers that the statistics imply that asthma is a significant risk factor and that asthmatics should not be permitted to dive. This opinion was prevalent for a long time, but recent studies by DAN suggest that asthma may be managed successfully in some cases. [ citation needed ] Factors contributing to death in this group include panic, fatigue and salt water aspiration, and the cause of death was usually drowning or pulmonary barotrauma. The diving environment can provoke or aggravate asthma in several ways, such as salt water aspiration, breathing cold dry air, strenuous exertion, hyperventilation. and high work of breathing. [3]\nIn 10% of the cases summarised by Edmonds et al., vomiting initiated or contributed to the accident. It was often caused by sea sickness or salt water aspiration or ingestion, but ear problems and alcohol were also cited as causes. [3]\nNitrogen narcosis was cited as a contributory or triggering factor in 9% of cases reviewed by Edmonds et al., but was never the sole cause of death. [3]\nRespiratory disease was cited as a factor in 7% of cases by Edmonds. Chronic bronchitis, pleural adhesions, chest injury and other respiratory conditions may pre-exist in the diver, and though a small minority of divers have these conditions, the frequency with which they are associated with fatalities suggest they may have been contributory. [3]\nRecreational drugs such as alcohol and cannabis have been implicated in many drownings, and cocaine is associated with sudden death in athletes. Edmonds reported an association between drugs used for treating hypertiension and asthma with sudden death syndrome. [3]\nFew recreational divers die as a consequence of decompression sickness, and it is more likely in technical divers exposed to considerably greater depths, and professional divers, but it is a significant cause of serious disability according to Edmonds. [3]\nEquipment [ edit ]\nEdmonds et al. (2014) suggest that a significant percentage of deaths are associated with equipment failure (35%) or misuse (35%), while the diving fatalities workshop of 2012 found that equipment failure per se was uncommon. This is not necessarily contradictory, as they include incompetent operation under equipment failure and specify overlap between malfunction and misuse. [3]\nIn 14% of deaths there was a regulator fault reported, and in 1% the regulator was misused. Subsequent testing of the regulators showed that most of the problems were caused by leaks resulting in inhalation of salt water, but in some cases there was excessive breathing resistance following a mechanical dysfunction. In a few cases the regulator failed catastrophically, or the hose burst. The difficulty of breathing from the regulator was often aggravated by other factors such as panic, exhaustion or badly adjusted buoyancy. [3]\nIn 8% of cases the buoyancy compensator malfunctioned. This was usually due to a problem with the inflator mechanism, but in some cases the BCD could not stay inflated. In 6% of the fatalities, the buoyancy compensator was not used competently, usually by overinflation which caused an uncontrolled ascent, or deflating when more buoyancy was required at the surface. [3] Overweighting can also be classified as misuse of equipment.\nEdmonds et al. found that 13% of victims lost one or both fins. This was sometimes due to defective or ill-fitting fins, but in most cases the cause was not apparent. In 12% of deaths there were problems associated with the cylinder, usually from user error, such as use of an underfilled or undersized cylinder, the cylinder becoming unsecured from the harness, and failure to open the cylinder valve. In less than 5% of fatalities, there were problems due to malfunction or misuse of weight belt (excluding overweighting which is not a failure of the equipment), harness, mask, exposure suit, submersible pressure gauges and entanglement in lines deployed by the diver. [3]\nEnvironment [ edit ]\nEdmonds et al. indicate that 25% of fatal incidents started at the surface, and 50% of the divers died at the surface. In many cases, the divers surfaced because they ran out of breathing air. [3]\nDifficult water conditions were implicated in 36% of fatalities in the Edmonds et al. summary. These included current stronger than the diver could manage, rough water, surf, surge from wave movement, and impaired visibility caused by these conditions. These conditions were frequently encountered when the diver was obliged to surface in an unsuitable place due to earlier problems, and were often exacerbated by overweighting and/or the high drag of an excessively inflated buoyancy compensator, leading to exhaustion or panic which resulted in drowning. [3]\nExcessive depth was considered a factor in 12% of fatalities summarized by Edmonds et al. The fatal dive was often the deepest ever for the victim. Greater depth can expose a diver to factors such as increased air consumption, impaired judgment caused by nitrogen narcosis, colder water, reduced thermal insulation of a compressed wetsuit, reduced visibility and lighting, slower response of buoyancy compensator inflation, increased work of breathing, greater heat loss when using helium mixtures, higher risk of decompression sickness and a necessarily prolonged ascent time. [3]\nOther environmental factors cited as contributory to fatalities include caves, marine animal injury (including shark and other animal bites, and marine stings, difficulties entering and exiting the water, cold, entanglements, entrapment, and night diving. [3]\nAccident investigation [ edit ]\nMain article: Investigation of diving accidents\nLack of solid information about the underlying causes of diving accidents and fatalities creates uncertainty, and this is the principal factor leading to litigation, higher insurance premiums, massive litigation costs and ultimately the continued loss of life. [1]\n—  David G. Concannon, 2011\nDiving fatality investigations are intended to find the cause of death by identifying factors that caused the fatal incident. Causes of diving accidents are the triggering events that when combined with inadequate response, lead to an adverse consequence which may be classified as a notifiable incident or an accident when injury or death follows. These causes can be categorised as human factors, equipment problems and environmental factors. Equipment problems and environmental factors are also often influenced by human error. [15] Three main areas of investigation are common:\nMedical investigation looks into the diver's health and medical factors that may have led to the cause of death.\nEquipment is investigated to look for issues that may have contributed to a cause of death.\nProcedural investigation considers whether the diver followed appropriate procedures, adequately prepared themselves and their equipment before diving, or went diving in conditions beyond their training and experience level. [1]\nThere is usually some form of investigation following a diving fatality. There may be several investigators representing different parties. Police are likely to look for evidence of homicide, The maritime safety authority will investigate in cases where a death occurs while diving from a vessel. When the fatality involves a person at work, the occupational health and safety authority may investigate, and investigators from the deceased's, insurance company and the dive operator and certification agency's insurance companies are likely to be involved. [16]\nIn most cases, the investigation takes place some time after the event. In cases where death has already occurred, the police may meet the boat, or travel to a shore site. An investigation by someone representing a sector of the diving industry may not take place until weeks or even months after the incident. It depends on how soon the event is reported, how long the paperwork takes, how soon the insurance carrier appoints an investigator and availability of a suitable investigator. No matter how quickly an investigation is launched, in most cases the body will have been recovered and resuscitation attempted, equipment will have been removed and possibly damaged or lost, and the people at the site returned to their homes. The equipment may have been mishandled by authorities who are unfamiliar with the gear and have stored it improperly, compromising the evidence. [16]\nPeople who would be likely to be considered witnesses include: [16]\nAny instructional staff involved if it was a training dive.\nAny crew-members of the boat if the dive was off a boat.\nOther divers who were diving at the site at the time of the incident.\nAny rescue and recovery personnel who may have been involved.\nAny members of a professional dive team if one of their members was involved.\nFatal incidents are less likely to occur during surface-supplied diving operations, even though the diving environment may be more hazardous, as the diver is supported by a diving team and the supervisor is able to monitor and communicate with the diver. The supply of breathing gas is more secure, and it is extremely unusual for the diver's umbilical to be severed, which means that the diver cannot normally get lost underwater.\nEquipment testing [ edit ]\nEquipment testing is an important part of dive accident and fatality analysis. As stakeholders in the community have different and occasionally conflicting needs when it comes to such testing, tests should be done as soon as possible to avoid degradation of evidence, and the testing should be done by impartial investigators, with all relevant equipment treated as evidence and legally acceptable procedures for controlling custody of the evidence. Currently the procedures for equipment testing after diving accidents are poorly standardized. Important procedural items include when testing should be conducted, who is responsible for the testing, what equipment should be tested and what tests should be done. [17]\nThis requires appropriate training of first responders and law enforcement agencies, availability of testing equipment, development of suitable test protocols, and funding to conduct the testing. Procedures for testing rebreathers differ from those for testing open circuit equipment. [17]\nLife-support equipment is an integral part of diving, and dive equipment is generally robust and reliable, but bad maintenance, design flaws, improper use, or other factors may cause or contribute to an incident. When equipment issues are not contributory to an incident, they should be excluded so that the causative factors may be correctly determined. [17]\nForensic autopsy [ edit ]\nIf diving fatalities are thoroughly investigated it may be possible to determine a trigger, or root cause, for the accident. Data collection and analysis allows identification of the most common triggers and contributing factors associated with fatal diving incidents. Forensic autopsies go beyond the detailed description of the internal organs and include a thorough external examination looking for injuries, injury patterns, trace evidence and clues to how the body and the environment may have interacted. Diving deaths are relatively uncommon, and may be unfamiliar to the pathologist. [18]\nThe forensic pathologist also needs to understand the limitations of autopsy findings in diving-related deaths and realize that there are common postmortem artifacts that can be misinterpreted, resulting in erroneous conclusions.\n—  James Carruso, Regional Armed Forces Medical Examiner, Navy Recruiting Command 2011\nLegal issues [ edit ]\nScuba diving fatalities have a major financial impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. [1]\nThe lack of reliable and reasonably complete information about the underlying causes of diving fatalities creates uncertainty. Inaccurate findings following autopsies where the examiner had no experience in diving fatalities and had not followed the relevant protocols are common, and in the majority of cases the primary causative factors are never identified, leading to opportunistic litigation.

The risks of dying during recreational , scientific or commercial diving are small, and on scuba , deaths are usually associated with poor gas management , poor buoyancy control , equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, though the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error on the part of the victim. [1] [2]\nEquipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba , and while the cause of death is commonly recorded as drowning , this is mainly the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events taking place in water. Arterial gas embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, and it, too, is the consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent , possibly aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. [3] There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases, the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research that could improve diver safety. [4]\nFor diving facilities, scuba diving fatalities have a major financial impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. [1]\nStatistics [ edit ]\nDiving fatality data published in Diving Medicine for Scuba Divers (2015) [3]\n90% died with their weight belt on.\n86% were alone when they died (either diving solo or separated from their buddy).\n50% did not inflate their buoyancy compensator.\n25% first got into difficulty on the surface\n50% died on the surface.\n10% were under training when they died.\n10% had been advised that they were medically unfit to dive .\n5% were cave diving .\n1% of divers attempting a rescue died as a result.\nFatality rates of 16.4 deaths per 100,000 persons per year among DAN America members and 14.4 deaths per 100,000 persons per year the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) members were similar and did not change during 2000–2006. This is comparable with jogging (13 deaths per 100,000 persons per year) and motor vehicle accidents (16 deaths per 100,000 persons per year), and within the range where reduction is desirable by Health and Safety Executive (HSE) criteria. [5]\nActivity-based statistics would be a more accurate measurement of risk. Noted above are statistics showing diving fatalities comparable to motor vehicle accidents of 16.4 per 100,000 divers and 16 per 100,000 drivers. DAN 2014/12/17 data shows there are 3.174 million divers in America. Their data shows that 2.351 million dive 1 to 7 times per year. 823,000 dive 8 or more times per year. It is reasonable to say that the average would be in the neighbourhood of 5 dives per year. [6]\nData for 17 million student-diver certifications during 63 million student dives over a 20-year period from 1989-2008 show a mean per capita death rate of 1.7 deaths per 100,000 student divers per year. This was lower than for insured DAN members during 2000–2006 at 16.4 deaths per 100,000 DAN members per year, but fatality rate per dive is a better measure of exposure risk, A mean annual fatality rate of 0.48 deaths per 100,000 student dives per year and 0.54 deaths per 100,000 BSAC dives per year and 1.03 deaths per 100,000 non-BSAC dives per year during 2007. The total size of the diving population is important for determining overall fatality rates, and the population estimates from the 1990s of several million U.S. divers need to be updated. [5]\nDuring 2006 to 2015 there were an estimated 306 million recreational dives made by US residents and 563 recreational diving deaths from this population. The fatality rate was 1.8 per million recreational dives, and 47 deaths for every 1000 emergency department presentations for scuba injuries. [7]\nThe most frequent known root cause for diving fatalities is running out of, or low on, breathing gas, but the reasons for this are not specified, probably due to lack of data. Other factors cited include buoyancy control, entanglement or entrapment, rough water, equipment misuse or problems and emergency ascent . The most common injuries and causes of death were drowning or asphyxia due to inhalation of water, air embolism and cardiac events. Risk of cardiac arrest is greater for older divers, and greater for men than women, although the risks are equal by age 65. [5]\nSeveral plausible opinions have been put forward but have not yet been empirically validated. Suggested contributing factors included inexperience, infrequent diving, inadequate supervision, insufficient predive briefings, buddy separation and dive conditions beyond the diver's training, experience or physical capacity. [5]\nAnnual fatalities [ edit ]\nThis section needs expansion with: data from other years and other geographical regions. You can help by adding to it . ( October 2023 )\nDAN was notified of 561 recreational scuba deaths during 2010 to 2013. 334 were actively investigated by DAN [8]\nDAN was notified of 146 recreational scuba deaths during 2014. 68 were actively investigated by DAN [9]\nDAN was notified of 127 recreational scuba deaths during 2015. 67 were actively investigated by DAN [10]\nDAN was notified of 169 recreational scuba deaths during 2016. 94 were actively investigated by DAN [11]\nDAN was notified of 228 recreational scuba deaths during 2017. 70 were actively investigated by DAN [12]\nDAN was notified of 189 recreational scuba deaths during 2018. [13]\nCause of death [ edit ]\nSee also: Investigation of diving accidents § Causes of diving accidents\nAccording to death certificates, over 80% of the deaths were ultimately attributed to drowning, but other factors usually combined to incapacitate the diver in a sequence of events culminating in drowning, which is more a consequence of the medium in which the accidents occurred than the actual accident. Often the drowning obscures the real cause of death . Scuba divers should not drown unless there are other contributory factors as they carry a supply of breathing gas and equipment designed to provide the gas on demand. Drowning occurs as a consequence of preceding problems, such as cardiac disease, pulmonary barotrauma, unmanageable stress , unconsciousness from any cause, water aspiration, trauma , equipment difficulties, environmental hazards, inappropriate response to an emergency or failure to manage the gas supply. [3]\nThe data gathered in relation to the actual causes of death is changing. Although drowning and arterial gas embolisms are cited in the top three causes of diver deaths, stating these as solitary causes does not recognise any pre-existing health issues. Researchers may know the actual causes of death, but the sequence of events that led to the cause of death is often not clear, especially when local officials or pathologists make assumptions. [14]\nIn many diving destinations , resources are not available for comprehensive investigations or complete autopsies , The 2010 DAN Diving Fatalities workshop noted that listing drowning as a cause of death is ineffective in determining what actually occurred in an incident, and that lack of information is the primary reason for personal injury lawsuits filed in the industry. [14]\nA DAN study published in 2008 investigated 947 recreational open-circuit scuba diving deaths from 1992–2003, and where sufficient information was available, classified the incidents in terms of a sequence of trigger, disabling agent, disabling injury and cause of death. Insufficient gas was the most frequent trigger, at 41%, followed by entrapment at 20%, and equipment problems at 15%. The most common identifiable disabling agents were emergency ascents, at 55%, followed by insufficient gas at 27% and buoyancy complications at 13%. The most frequent disabling injuries were asphyxia at 33%, arterial gas embolism at 29% and cardiac incidents at 26%. Cause of death was reported as drowning in 70% of the cases, arterial gas embolism in 14% and cardiac arrest in 13%. The investigator concluded that disabling injuries were more relevant than cause of death, as drowning often occurred as a consequence of a disabling injury. A further analysis linked risk of type of disabling injury with trigger events. Asphyxia followed entrapment (40%), insufficient gas (32%), buoyancy problems (17%), equipment problems (15%), rough water (11%). Arterial gas embolism was associated with emergency ascent (96%), insufficient gas (63%), equipment trouble (17%), entrapment (9%). Cardiac incidents were associated with cardiovascular disease and age over 40 years. Their conclusion was that the most effective way to reduce diving deaths would be by minimising the frequency of adverse events. [4]\nManner of death [ edit ]\nIf the manner of death is deemed to be accidental (or due to misadventure, where this is applicable), which is usually the case, the incident leading to death is seldom analysed sufficiently to be useful in determining the probable sequence of events, particularly the triggering event, and therefore is not usually useful for improving diver safety. [1] [14]\nThe chain of events leading to diving fatalities is varied in detail, but there are common elements: a triggering event, which leads to a disabling or harmful event and causes a disabling injury, which may itself be fatal or lead to drowning. One or more of the four events may not be unidentifiable. [14]\nDeath usually followed a sequence or combination of events, most of which may have been survivable in isolation. In the more than 940 fatality statistics studied by DAN over ten years, only one-third of the triggers could be identified. The most common of these were: [1] [14]\nInsufficient gas (41%)\nEntrapment (20%)\nEquipment problems (15%)\nDisabling agents were also identified in one-third of the cases. The most common identified were: [1]\nEmergency ascent (55%)\nInsufficient gas (27%)\nBuoyancy trouble (13%)\nDisabling injuries [ edit ]\nDisabling injuries were identified in nearly two-thirds of the cases. [1] The criteria for identify the disabling injury by forensic judgement are specified. [4]\nAsphyxia (33%), with or without aspiration of water, and no evidence of a previous disabling injury.\nTriggering events associated with asphyxia included: [4]\n(40%) entrapment due to entanglement in kelp , wreckage, mooring lines, fishing lines or nets, and entrapment in confined spaces or under ice\n(32%) insufficient gas, when it was the first identifiable problem, but generally the reason for lack of gas was not determined.\n(15%) problems with equipment included regulator free-flow, unexpectedly high gas consumption, and diver error in the use of the scuba apparatus, buoyancy compensator, weighting system or dry suit.\n(11%) rough water conditions included high sea states, strong currents, and surf conditions at beaches, rocky shores and piers.\nDisabling agents associated with asphyxia cases included: [4]\n(62%) insufficient gas, triggered by entrapment, equipment problems, or high gas consumption due to heavy exercise in rough conditions.\n(17%) buoyancy problems, triggered by over- or under-weighting, lack of inflation gas for the buoyancy compensator, or over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit.\n(13%) emergency ascent, triggered by entrapment or lack of breathing gas, was associated with both asphyxia and lung overpressure injury.\nOther contributing factors were not as clearly connected: Panic was reported in about a fifth of the cases, and may have caused aspiration or accelerated gas consumption. Casualties were diving alone or were separated from their buddies in about 40% of cases with asphyxia, but this was also associated with other disabling injuries.\nArterial gas embolism (29%), with gas detected in cerebral arteries, evidence of lung rupture, and history of an emergency ascent.\nTriggers associated with AGE included: [4]\n(63%) insufficient gas,\n(17%) equipment problems,\n(9%) entanglement or entrapment\nAGE deaths were often associated with panic.\nDisabling agents associated with AGE cases included: [4]\n(96%) emergency ascent. Loss of consciousness was typical, followed by drowning for divers who remained in the water after surfacing.\nCardiac incidents (26%), where chest discomfort was indicated by the diver, distress displayed with no obvious cause, a history of cardiac disease and autopsy evidence.\nThere were few overt triggers or disabling agents identified, but reports suggested that about 60% of the decedents displayed symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain or other distress, and 10% displayed these symptoms before the dive.\nProblems were noticed before entering the water in 24% of these cases, at the bottom in 46% of cases, and after starting the ascent in 20% of cases\nLoss of consciousness could occur at any time.\nAutopsy reports usually showed evidence of significant cardiovascular disease but seldom myocardial damage, which suggests that fatal dysrhythmias or drowning may have occurred before heart muscle injury could develop.\nDisabling cardiac incidents were associated with cardiovascular disease and age greater than 40 years, but no significant association with body mass index. [4]\nTrauma (5%), where a traumatic incident was witnessed or determined by autopsy. The cause of injury is usually obvious, and included incidents of being struck by a watercraft, tumbled over a rocky shoreline by surf, electric shock, and interactions with marine animals. Some could possibly have been avoided by the diver. Traumatic injuries were most commonly associated with rough water conditions and being a frequent diver. [4]\nDecompression sickness (3.5%), based on symptoms, signs and autopsy findings. Triggers for DCS included: [4]\ninsufficient gas, followed by emergency ascent with omitted decompression.\nmultiple repetitive dives with short surface intervals.\ngas lost in a regulator free-flow\nuncontrolled ascent due to dry suit inflator malfunction\ndragged deep by a speared fish\nDCS was associated with deep diving, diving alone, and emergency ascent with omitted decompression\nUnexplained loss of consciousness (2.5%), where the diver was discovered unconscious without obvious cause. [4]\nTriggers may have included deep dives, diabetes and nitrox dives, including a seizure witnessed at a depth where the oxygen partial pressure would have been approximately 1 bar, normally considered safe.\nLoss of consciousness was associated with diabetes, frequent diving, and learner divers.\nInappropriate gas (2%), Breathing gas supply contaminated by toxic levels of carbon monoxide, or selection of gas with excessive or insufficient oxygen content for the depth. [4]\nCNS oxygen toxicity, in some cases associated with medications.\nCarbon monoxide poisoning from contaminated cylinder gas\nHypoxia, from incorrect gas choice and from oxygen content depleted by corrosion in the cylinder\nAssociation and causality [ edit ]\nThe traditional procedure for developing diving safety recommendations is based on the assumption that associations of circumstances with fatalities are causative. This is reasonable in cases where the cause both precedes the effect and is logically clearly connected, such as where entanglement precedes asphyxia, but in many cases indirect associations are not clearly causative and require further verification. This may not be possible when there is insufficient data. Confident causal inference requires consistent associations that do not conflict with logical medical and engineering reasoning. [4]\nAnalysis of case information for diving fatalities has identified a wide variety of triggers and disabling agents, but has also shown that most fatalities are associated with a small group of these triggers and disabling agents, which suggests that a large reduction in fatalities could be achieved by concentrating on remedying these key factors. Many of these could be improved by training and practice, some by a change of attitude, but some diving fatalities appear to be unavoidable as the risk is inherent in the activity and depends on factors that are not under the control of the diver. [4]\nThe most frequent trigger appears to be insufficient breathing gas. This can obviously be avoided by paying more attention to gas management and having a reliable emergency gas supply available. The next most frequent trigger, entanglement, can largely be avoided by keeping clear of obvious entanglement hazards, and can be mitigated by extrication skills, tools and an adequate gas supply while busy. A competent buddy is clearly of great value in cases where the diver cannot see or reach the snag point. The third ranking trigger was equipment failure, but the variety of failures possible is large, and diving equipment in good condition is generally very reliable. No particular item appears to be obviously less reliable. Good maintenance, testing of function before use, carrying redundant critical equipment and skill at correcting the more critical malfunctions are fairly obvious remedies. [4]\nThe most frequent disabling agent in response to a trigger appears to be emergency ascent. Clearly, avoiding the trigger would eliminate the disabling agent, and this should be the top priority, but the ability to cope effectively with an emergency that does occur would break the sequence of uncontrolled and harmful events, and probably avoid a fatality. A fully independent alternate air source or a fully competent and reliable buddy are the obvious solutions, as more than half of the victims were on their own preceding death. [4]\nInappropriate buoyancy was the most frequently identified adverse event, with negative buoyancy more common than positive buoyancy. On some occasions the buoyancy problem was sudden and control was lost quickly, but on many occasions there was a longer term effect of non-catastrophic but chronic over-weighting which led to overexertion and rapid gas consumption, leaving the diver less capable of coping with the stress of the next problem to occur. Buoyancy issues could be a more important contributing factor than is immediately apparent. [4]\nContributory factors [ edit ]\nThe \"DAN Annual Diving Report 2016 edition\" lists their Ten Most Wanted Improvements in Scuba as: [9] : 5 \nCorrect weighting\nGreater buoyancy control\nMore attention to gas planning\nBetter ascent rate control\nIncreased use of checklists\nFewer equalizing injuries\nImproved cardiovascular health in divers\nDiving more often (or more pre-trip refresher training)\nGreater attention to diving within limits\nFewer equipment issues / improved maintenance\nDiving techniques, competence, and experience [ edit ]\nMore than half of diving fatalities may be a consequence of violations of accepted good practice. Divers who died for reasons other than a medical cause were found to be about 7 times more likely to have one or more violations of recommended practice associated with the fatality. [2]\nThe DAN fatalities workshop of 2011 found that there is a real problem that divers do not follow the procedures they have been trained in, and dive significantly beyond their training, experience, and fitness levels, and that this was the basic cause of most accidents. In litigation involving diving accidents, the legal panel reported that 85% to 90% of the cases were attributable to diver error. This is consistent with several scientific studies. Medical issues are a significant part of the problem, and certified divers are responsible for assessing their own fitness and ability to do any particular dive. Experience was also cited as a significant factor, with occasional divers at higher risk than regular divers, and the majority of fatalities had only entry level or slightly higher qualification (\" Advanced open-water diver \" certification is included in this grouping). [1]\nA large percentage (40 to 60%) of deaths in the Edmonds summary were associated with panic, a psychological reaction to stress which is characterized by irrational and unhelpful behaviour, which reduces the chances of survival. Panic typically occurs when a susceptible diver is in a threatening and unfamiliar situation, such as running out of breathing gas, or loss of ability to control depth, and is commonly complicated by inappropriate response to the triggering situation, which generally makes the situation worse. Evidence of panic is derived from behavioural reports from eyewitnesses. [3]\nInadequate gas supply [ edit ]\nThe ANZ survey found in 56% of fatalities and the DAN survey in 41%, that the diver was either running low or was out of breathing gas . When equipment was tested following death, few victims had an ample gas supply remaining. The surveys indicated that most problems started when the diver became aware of a low on air situation. 8% of the divers died while trying to snorkel on the surface, apparently trying to conserve air. Concern about a shortage of air may affect the diver's ability to cope with a second problem which may develop during the dive, or may cause the diver to surface early and possibly alone in a stressed state of mind, where he is then unable to cope with surface conditions. [3]\nBuoyancy problems [ edit ]\nIn the ANZ survey, 52% of the fatalities had buoyancy problems. Most of these were due to inadequate buoyancy, but 8% had excessive buoyancy. In the DAN survey buoyancy problems were the most common trigger event leading to death. Buoyancy changes associated with wetsuits were found to be a significant factor. Based on a formula for approximate weight requirement based on wetsuit style and thickness, 40% of the divers who died were found to be grossly over-weighted at the surface. This would have been aggravated by suit compression at depth. [3]\nA correctly weighted diver should be neutrally buoyant at or near the surface with cylinders nearly empty. In this state, descent and ascent are equally easy. This requires the diver to be slightly negative at the start of the dive, due to the weight of the gas in the full cylinders, but this and the buoyancy loss due to suit compression should be easily compensated by partial inflation of the buoyancy compensator. The practice of over-weighting is dangerous at it may overwhelm the capacity of the buoyancy compensator and makes the buoyancy changes with depth more extreme and difficult to correct. A failure of the buoyancy compensator would be exacerbated. This dangerous practice is unfortunately promoted by some instructors as it expedites shallow water training and allows divers to learn to descend without fully learning the appropriate skills. [3] Greater skill is required to dive safely with more weight than is necessary, but no amount of skill can compensate for insufficient weighting during decompression stops. On dives where decompression is planned, competent divers will often carry a bit more weight than strictly necessary to ensure that in a situation where they have lost or used up all their gas and are relying on a supply from a team member, they do not have to struggle to stay down at the correct stop depth. Some divers may be unaware of the need to adjust weight to suit any change in equipment that may affect buoyancy, due to inadequate training. Some dive shops do not provide facilities for the diver to adjust weighting to suit the combined equipment when renting a full set of gear to someone who has not used that combination before, and just add a few weights to ensure the diver can get down at the start of the dive.\nIn a survey on buddy diver fatality it was found that regardless of who was first to be low on air, the over-weighted diver was six times more likely to die. [3]\nIn spite of being heavily reliant on their buoyancy compensators, many divers also misused them. Examples of this include accidental inflation or over-inflation causing rapid uncontrolled ascents, confusion between the inflation and dump valves, and inadequate or slow inflation due to being deep or low on air. The drag caused by a buoyancy compensator inflated to offset the weight belt can contribute to exhaustion in divers attempting to swim to safety on the surface. The American Academy of Underwater Sciences reported in 1989 that half the cases of decompression sickness were related to loss of buoyancy control. [3] When twin-bladder buoyancy compensators are used, confusion as to how much gas is in each bladder can lead to a delay in appropriate response, by which time control of the ascent may have already been lost.\nFailure to ditch weights [ edit ]\n90% of the fatalities did not ditch their weights. Those on the surface had to swim towards safety carrying several kilograms of unnecessary weight, which made staying at the surface more difficult than it needed to be. In some fatalities the weights had been released but became entangled. In other cases, the belt could not be released because it was worn under other equipment, or the release buckle was inaccessible because a weight had slid over it, or it had rotated to the back of the body. Other fatalities have occurred where release mechanisms have failed. [3]\nBuddy system failures [ edit ]\nIn spite of the general acceptance, teaching and recommendation of the buddy system by most, if not all diver certification organisations, only 14% of divers who died still had their buddy with them at the time. In a Hawaiian study 19% of the fatalities died with their buddy present. In the ANZ study 33% of the fatalities either dived alone or voluntarily separated from their buddies before the incident, 25% separated after a problem developed and 20% were separated by the problem. In the DAN study, 57% of those who started diving with a buddy were separated at the time of death. [3]\nThe buddy is primarily there to assist when things go wrong to the extent that the diver cannot cope alone, and the absence of a buddy is not in itself a threat to life. Buddy separation cannot be a cause of death, it is simply a failure of an engineering redundancy, leaving the diver without backup in case of specific emergencies, and the appropriate response is to abort the dive, as for any other failure of a singly redundant safety critical item. However, unplanned buddy separation may imply that the missing buddy has already run into trouble beyond their capacity to resolve. A common cause of separation was one diver running low on air and leaving their buddy to continue the dive alone. In some cases more than two divers dived together, without adequate team planning, leading to confusion as to who was responsible for whom. Groups of divers following a dive leader without formal buddy pairing before the dive would be split into pairs to surface by the dive leader as they reached low air status. This would frequently pair the least experienced and competent divers for the ascent including those over-breathing due to anxiety. [3]\nIn others cases, the survivor was leading the victim and not immediately aware of the problem. It is common for the more experienced diver to lead, and also common for the follower not to remain in a position where he can easily be monitored, so the follower may only get intermittent attention and may be inconveniently situated when something goes wrong. By the time the lead diver notices the absence of the buddy it may be too late to assist. [3] Each buddy is responsible for ensuring that the other knows where they are at all times.\nBuddy rescue [ edit ]\nIn a minority of cases the buddy was present at the time of death. In 1% of cases the buddy died attempting rescue. [3] In at least one case the survivor had to forcibly retrieve their primary demand valve from a buddy who was apparently unwilling or unable to share it after the secondary demand valve was rejected during an assisted ascent. [10]\nBuddy breathing [ edit ]\n4% of fatalities were associated with failed buddy breathing . [3]\nIn a study of failed buddy breathing conducted by NUADC, more than half were attempted at depths greater than 20 metres. In 29% the victim's mask was displaced, and a lung over-pressure injury occurred in 12.5% of cases. One in 8 victims refused to return the demand valve , however, donating a regulator rarely results in the donor becoming the victim. The use of a secondary ( octopus regulator ) second stage or a completely separate emergency air supply ( bailout cylinder ) would appear to be a safer alternative. [3]\nPhysiological factors [ edit ]\nA survey of DAN America members during 2000 to 2006 indicated a low incidence of cardiac-related fatalities in divers less than 40 years old. The rates increased until about 50 years old and stabilised for older divers at a relative risk of approximately 13 times greater than for younger divers. Relative risk for older divers was also found to be greater for asphyxia (3.9 times) and arterial gas embolism (2.5 times). Relative risk between males and females reduced from about 6 to 1 at 25 years to even at 65 years. DAN Europe statistics follow a similar trend.\nThe victim had a pre-existing condition which would widely be considered a contraindication to diving in about 25% of fatalities. Some disorders have no demonstrable pathology and are easily overlooked in an investigation, which results in incomplete understanding of the incident. Drowning can obscure some pathologies which may then not show up at autopsy. [3]\nFatigue was a factor in a significant number of cases (28% according to Edmonds). Fatigue is caused by excessive exertion, is aggravated by physical unfitness, and reduces the reserves available for survival. Factors cited as causes of fatigue include excessive drag due to over-weighting, drag due to over-inflation of the BCD, and long surface swims in adverse sea conditions, and it was not restricted to unfit divers. Fatigue was also associated with salt-water aspiration syndrome , cardiac problems and asthma. [3]\nSalt water aspiration was a factor in 37% of cases in the Edmonds summary. This refers to inhalation of a small amount of sea water by the conscious diver, often in the form of spray. Salt water aspiration may be caused by a regulator leak, rough conditions on the surface, or residual water in the regulator after regulator recovery or buddy breathing. Salt water aspiration may cause respiratory distress, fatigue or panic and other complications. [3]\nAutopsy evidence of pulmonary barotrauma was found in 13% of the cases summarised by Edmonds et al. This was sometimes a complicating factor, but at other times the direct cause of death. Factors associated with pulmonary barotrauma include panic, rapid buoyant ascent, asthma and regulator failure. In half of these cases a cause for the barotrauma was identified, but a roughly equal number remain unexplained. [3]\nIn cases where the Edmonds summary found cardiac failure was implicated there was either gross cardiac pathology or a clinical indication of cardiac disease in the autopsy findings. 26% of deaths in the DAN studies were due to cardiac failure. 60% of these victims complained of chest pain, dyspnoea or feeling unwell before or during the dive. Cardiac causes are implicated in about 45% of scuba deaths in divers over 40 years old, and they tend to be relatively experienced divers, frequently with a history of cardiac disease or high blood pressure. The associated triggers include exercise, drugs, hypoxia from salt water aspiration, cardio-pulmonary reflexes, respiratory abnormalities, restrictive dive suits and harness, and cold exposure. [3]\nin at least 9% of fatalities in the ANZ survey cited by Edmonds et al. the diver was asthmatic, and in at least 8% of the cases asthma contributed to the death. In other surveys this correlation is not so clear. Surveys have shown that between 0.5% and 1% of recreational divers are asthmatics. Edmonds considers that the statistics imply that asthma is a significant risk factor and that asthmatics should not be permitted to dive. This opinion was prevalent for a long time, but recent studies by DAN suggest that asthma may be managed successfully in some cases. [ citation needed ] Factors contributing to death in this group include panic, fatigue and salt water aspiration, and the cause of death was usually drowning or pulmonary barotrauma. The diving environment can provoke or aggravate asthma in several ways, such as salt water aspiration, breathing cold dry air, strenuous exertion, hyperventilation. and high work of breathing. [3]\nIn 10% of the cases summarised by Edmonds et al., vomiting initiated or contributed to the accident. It was often caused by sea sickness or salt water aspiration or ingestion, but ear problems and alcohol were also cited as causes. [3]\nNitrogen narcosis was cited as a contributory or triggering factor in 9% of cases reviewed by Edmonds et al., but was never the sole cause of death. [3]\nRespiratory disease was cited as a factor in 7% of cases by Edmonds. Chronic bronchitis, pleural adhesions, chest injury and other respiratory conditions may pre-exist in the diver, and though a small minority of divers have these conditions, the frequency with which they are associated with fatalities suggest they may have been contributory. [3]\nRecreational drugs such as alcohol and cannabis have been implicated in many drownings, and cocaine is associated with sudden death in athletes. Edmonds reported an association between drugs used for treating hypertiension and asthma with sudden death syndrome. [3]\nFew recreational divers die as a consequence of decompression sickness, and it is more likely in technical divers exposed to considerably greater depths, and professional divers, but it is a significant cause of serious disability according to Edmonds. [3]\nEquipment [ edit ]\nEdmonds et al. (2014) suggest that a significant percentage of deaths are associated with equipment failure (35%) or misuse (35%), while the diving fatalities workshop of 2012 found that equipment failure per se was uncommon. This is not necessarily contradictory, as they include incompetent operation under equipment failure and specify overlap between malfunction and misuse. [3]\nIn 14% of deaths there was a regulator fault reported, and in 1% the regulator was misused. Subsequent testing of the regulators showed that most of the problems were caused by leaks resulting in inhalation of salt water, but in some cases there was excessive breathing resistance following a mechanical dysfunction. In a few cases the regulator failed catastrophically, or the hose burst. The difficulty of breathing from the regulator was often aggravated by other factors such as panic, exhaustion or badly adjusted buoyancy. [3]\nIn 8% of cases the buoyancy compensator malfunctioned. This was usually due to a problem with the inflator mechanism, but in some cases the BCD could not stay inflated. In 6% of the fatalities, the buoyancy compensator was not used competently, usually by overinflation which caused an uncontrolled ascent, or deflating when more buoyancy was required at the surface. [3] Overweighting can also be classified as misuse of equipment.\nEdmonds et al. found that 13% of victims lost one or both fins. This was sometimes due to defective or ill-fitting fins, but in most cases the cause was not apparent. In 12% of deaths there were problems associated with the cylinder, usually from user error, such as use of an underfilled or undersized cylinder, the cylinder becoming unsecured from the harness, and failure to open the cylinder valve. In less than 5% of fatalities, there were problems due to malfunction or misuse of weight belt (excluding overweighting which is not a failure of the equipment), harness, mask, exposure suit, submersible pressure gauges and entanglement in lines deployed by the diver. [3]\nEnvironment [ edit ]\nEdmonds et al. indicate that 25% of fatal incidents started at the surface, and 50% of the divers died at the surface. In many cases, the divers surfaced because they ran out of breathing air. [3]\nDifficult water conditions were implicated in 36% of fatalities in the Edmonds et al. summary. These included current stronger than the diver could manage, rough water, surf, surge from wave movement, and impaired visibility caused by these conditions. These conditions were frequently encountered when the diver was obliged to surface in an unsuitable place due to earlier problems, and were often exacerbated by overweighting and/or the high drag of an excessively inflated buoyancy compensator, leading to exhaustion or panic which resulted in drowning. [3]\nExcessive depth was considered a factor in 12% of fatalities summarized by Edmonds et al. The fatal dive was often the deepest ever for the victim. Greater depth can expose a diver to factors such as increased air consumption, impaired judgment caused by nitrogen narcosis, colder water, reduced thermal insulation of a compressed wetsuit, reduced visibility and lighting, slower response of buoyancy compensator inflation, increased work of breathing, greater heat loss when using helium mixtures, higher risk of decompression sickness and a necessarily prolonged ascent time. [3]\nOther environmental factors cited as contributory to fatalities include caves, marine animal injury (including shark and other animal bites, and marine stings, difficulties entering and exiting the water, cold, entanglements, entrapment, and night diving. [3]\nAccident investigation [ edit ]\nMain article: Investigation of diving accidents\nLack of solid information about the underlying causes of diving accidents and fatalities creates uncertainty, and this is the principal factor leading to litigation, higher insurance premiums, massive litigation costs and ultimately the continued loss of life. [1]\n—  David G. Concannon, 2011\nDiving fatality investigations are intended to find the cause of death by identifying factors that caused the fatal incident. Causes of diving accidents are the triggering events that when combined with inadequate response, lead to an adverse consequence which may be classified as a notifiable incident or an accident when injury or death follows. These causes can be categorised as human factors, equipment problems and environmental factors. Equipment problems and environmental factors are also often influenced by human error. [15] Three main areas of investigation are common:\nMedical investigation looks into the diver's health and medical factors that may have led to the cause of death.\nEquipment is investigated to look for issues that may have contributed to a cause of death.\nProcedural investigation considers whether the diver followed appropriate procedures, adequately prepared themselves and their equipment before diving, or went diving in conditions beyond their training and experience level. [1]\nThere is usually some form of investigation following a diving fatality. There may be several investigators representing different parties. Police are likely to look for evidence of homicide, The maritime safety authority will investigate in cases where a death occurs while diving from a vessel. When the fatality involves a person at work, the occupational health and safety authority may investigate, and investigators from the deceased's, insurance company and the dive operator and certification agency's insurance companies are likely to be involved. [16]\nIn most cases, the investigation takes place some time after the event. In cases where death has already occurred, the police may meet the boat, or travel to a shore site. An investigation by someone representing a sector of the diving industry may not take place until weeks or even months after the incident. It depends on how soon the event is reported, how long the paperwork takes, how soon the insurance carrier appoints an investigator and availability of a suitable investigator. No matter how quickly an investigation is launched, in most cases the body will have been recovered and resuscitation attempted, equipment will have been removed and possibly damaged or lost, and the people at the site returned to their homes. The equipment may have been mishandled by authorities who are unfamiliar with the gear and have stored it improperly, compromising the evidence. [16]\nPeople who would be likely to be considered witnesses include: [16]\nAny instructional staff involved if it was a training dive.\nAny crew-members of the boat if the dive was off a boat.\nOther divers who were diving at the site at the time of the incident.\nAny rescue and recovery personnel who may have been involved.\nAny members of a professional dive team if one of their members was involved.\nFatal incidents are less likely to occur during surface-supplied diving operations, even though the diving environment may be more hazardous, as the diver is supported by a diving team and the supervisor is able to monitor and communicate with the diver. The supply of breathing gas is more secure, and it is extremely unusual for the diver's umbilical to be severed, which means that the diver cannot normally get lost underwater.\nEquipment testing [ edit ]\nEquipment testing is an important part of dive accident and fatality analysis. As stakeholders in the community have different and occasionally conflicting needs when it comes to such testing, tests should be done as soon as possible to avoid degradation of evidence, and the testing should be done by impartial investigators, with all relevant equipment treated as evidence and legally acceptable procedures for controlling custody of the evidence. Currently the procedures for equipment testing after diving accidents are poorly standardized. Important procedural items include when testing should be conducted, who is responsible for the testing, what equipment should be tested and what tests should be done. [17]\nThis requires appropriate training of first responders and law enforcement agencies, availability of testing equipment, development of suitable test protocols, and funding to conduct the testing. Procedures for testing rebreathers differ from those for testing open circuit equipment. [17]\nLife-support equipment is an integral part of diving, and dive equipment is generally robust and reliable, but bad maintenance, design flaws, improper use, or other factors may cause or contribute to an incident. When equipment issues are not contributory to an incident, they should be excluded so that the causative factors may be correctly determined. [17]\nForensic autopsy [ edit ]\nIf diving fatalities are thoroughly investigated it may be possible to determine a trigger, or root cause, for the accident. Data collection and analysis allows identification of the most common triggers and contributing factors associated with fatal diving incidents. Forensic autopsies go beyond the detailed description of the internal organs and include a thorough external examination looking for injuries, injury patterns, trace evidence and clues to how the body and the environment may have interacted. Diving deaths are relatively uncommon, and may be unfamiliar to the pathologist. [18]\nThe forensic pathologist also needs to understand the limitations of autopsy findings in diving-related deaths and realize that there are common postmortem artifacts that can be misinterpreted, resulting in erroneous conclusions.\n—  James Carruso, Regional Armed Forces Medical Examiner, Navy Recruiting Command 2011\nLegal issues [ edit ]\nScuba diving fatalities have a major financial impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. [1]\nThe lack of reliable and reasonably complete information about the underlying causes of diving fatalities creates uncertainty. Inaccurate findings following autopsies where the examiner had no experience in diving fatalities and had not followed the relevant protocols are common, and in the majority of cases the primary causative factors are never identified, leading to opportunistic litigation.

Abnormal heartbeats, also known as arrythmias, can be a marker of cardiac compromise. This study follows 110 divers during six scuba diving trips and characterizes the factors that contribute to any post-diving arrythmias.\nDiving Incident Reporting System\nStatus: Current Research\nThe diving incident reporting system (DIRS) is one of the tools we use to gain insight into the not-so-pleasant experiences divers sometimes have. The purpose of this ongoing study is to collect and analyze voluntarily submitted reports of breath-hold and scuba diving safety mishaps reports in order to reduce injuries and fatalities.\nSurveillance of Fatal Injuries in Diving\nStatus: Current Research\nUntil we succeed in making every dive accident- and injury-free, DAN will continue to collect and analyze information about dive fatalities. The purpose of this database is to monitor trends in fatal injuries and identify risk factors associated with fatal diving accidents.\nThe Mechanics of Spinal Cord Decompression Sickness\nStatus: Current Research\nSpinal cord decompression sickness is among the most serious forms of decompression illness. This project studies the mechanics of how bubbles damage the spinal cord by using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging to observe bubble growth and tissue damage in decompressing tissue samples. The goal is to improve recompression treatment.\nSymptoms After Treatment for Decompression Illness: A Prospective Survey\nStatus: Current Research\nThe purpose of this prospective study is to estimate the occurrence of returning or worsening symptoms of DCI in both divers that fly after treatment and treated divers that do not and to determine how long divers wait before flying after treatment for DCI.\nExploring Decompression Bubbles Using Advanced Ultrasound Techniques\nStatus: Current Research\nVenous gas emboli (VGE) are bubbles that can appear in the blood after a dive due to decompression. These bubbles are detectable using ultrasound imaging and provide a measure of decompression stress. Advanced ultrasound imaging techniques are being developed at UNC for detecting these microbubbles and differentiating them from VGE.\nPosts navigation\nOlder posts\nHome\nSite Map\nPolicies\nTerms & Conditions\nAdvertise\nContact Us\n© DAN, Inc.
