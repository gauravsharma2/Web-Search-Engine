Well even some experienced divers don't know (or have forgotten) that scuba is an acronym for Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus. So scuba diving is using that equipment to explore the underwater world.\nThese days the word 'scuba' is used to describe the sport itself. It is also acceptable to refer to 'scuba equipment' or 'scuba gear' in conversation – even though part of the acronym is 'apparatus'.\nHow ever the name scuba is used it is an incredible experience. From turtles to nudibranchs, whale sharks to seahorses and fish to coral the underwater world is bright, colourful and alluring. Chuck in caves, wrecks and 1000m drop offs and it is also very exciting.\nSo if you want to know where to dive next check out the holidays, courses, experiences, accommodation, discounts and blogs below.

Or what you’d like to see? Some destinations offer year-round diving, while other regions offer better diving or specific marine life sightings during certain months. To make sure you find yourself in the right place at the right time, we have put together an annual dive calendar of the best diving destinations by month.\nNot sure what month is best for scuba diving? In this blog, you’ll find the highlights and hotspots worldwide for each month. Read on to find out the best diving destinations by month, to help you decide when and where you should take your next dive trip . The world, quite literally, is yours to explore!\nTable of Contents\nJanuary\nFebruary\nMarch\nApril\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAugust\nSeptember\nOctober\nNovember\nDecember\nDiscover the world’s best dive destinations\nJANUARY\nIf you live in the Northern Hemisphere, January can be one of the worst months of the year, with chilly temperatures and long, dark days. With a good few months ahead until spring, a trip to one of the best winter diving destinations is a great way to break up the gloomy period\nwith some tropical sunshine!\nThe best diving destinations in January:\nIf Asia is on your bucket list, then the pristine islands of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean and Palau offer great opportunities for pelagic encounters . In the Middle East, Djibouti is a nursery for juvenile whale sharks. If the Americas are more your preference, then locations such as Costa Rica , Cuba , the Cayman Islands , and the Caribbean experience some of their best weather during the first month. January also brings peak summertime in New Zealand and the chance to witness hunting orcas.\nFor snow lovers and those with a thirst for adventure, why not embrace the cold , get a dry suit on, and head for the spectacular land and seascapes of Antarctica or the Norwegian Fjords? This is a liveaboard adventure like no other!\nJanuary’s marine life highlight :\nDuring winter, hundreds of manatees\nmigrate from the Gulf of Mexico to the warm springs of Crystal River, Florida . Head to Three Sisters Springs and Homosassa Springs to join the action. It’s also the only place in North America where it’s legal to swim with this protected sirenia species .\nRecommended course for January diving:\nBecause January is the coldest month of the year in many parts of the world, we recommend checking off your PADI Dry Suit Diver certification in order to get the most out of these spectacular scuba destinations.\nLEARN MORE ABOUT DIVING IN JANUARY\nFEBRUARY\nFebruary can be a bit of a no-man’s-land on the calendar. The festive season seems like a million years ago, and summer seems to be equally far away in the future. So why not put February on your diving calendar and transform this dreary month into a month worth shouting about?\nThe best diving destinations in February:\nWhen it comes to the best places to dive in February, this month is a prime time for several great marine life seasons around the world. Why get stuck in a rut at home when you could be diving with hundreds of hammerheads in the Bahamas and Malpelo ? If Africa is a draw card for you, then February is when you have the best chances of whale shark encounters in Tanzania .\nFavorable weather conditions make February a perfect month to meet the mantas of the Andaman Sea and Raja Ampat , or to explore the astounding eco-diversity of North Sulawesi . Meanwhile, if you want to experience something out of the ordinary, head to Iceland for the warmth of the hydrothermal vents.\nFebruary’s marine life highlight :\nMexico’s Pacific Coast sees its peak whale-watching season during February. From the beach, tourist boats, or even underwater, you might just witness sperm whales, humpback whales, gray whales with their young, or even the elusive blue whale .\nRecommended course for February diving:\nIf you’re visiting any of the most popular scuba diving destinations during February, you’ll want to ensure you can safely dive to depths of 100 feet/30 meters . Enroll in and complete the online knowledge development of your PADI Advanced Open Water Diver course before departure, then complete the in-water training during your vacation.\nLEARN MORE ABOUT DIVING IN FEBRUARY\nMARCH\nIn many regions around the world, March marks the beginning of a shift in seasons , and it’s the same in our oceans . During March, many destinations experience a similar change in diving conditions.\nThe best diving destinations in March:\nFor those planning a trip to the best diving destinations in the Caribbean , there is still time as conditions remain calm for a few more months, but larger animals begin to migrate. To witness thousands of humpback whales in breeding season, visit the Dominican Republic , or encounter whale sharks in Honduras . Meanwhile, over 50 shark species (plus manatees and crocodiles ) can be spotted in Cuba .\nThe Galapagos Islands experience impressive marine life migrations during March, including large schools of hammerhead sharks . This is also when mating humpback whales are found off the coast of Hawaii , one of the best scuba diving destinations in the US .\nIn March, Vietnam ‘s diving is just getting started. Elsewhere, some regions are nearing the end of their peak season, so if you want to dive in Chuuk (Truk) Lagoon or other islands in the South Pacific, March is a great time to pick up some great deals on liveaboards .\nMarch’s marine life highlight :\nMozambique is a year-round megafauna hotspot, but visit in March for something special: peak nesting season for five turtle species . Hundreds of females gather on sandy beaches, each laying over 100 eggs before the hatchlings bid for freedom about two months later.\nRecommended course for March diving:\nShould you wish to take advantage of those amazing liveaboard deals, it’s recommended that you’re Nitrox certified . That way, you can enjoy longer dives and shorter surface intervals. Start your PADI Enriched Air Diver course now.\nLEARN MORE ABOUT DIVING IN MARCH\nAPRIL\nSpring is in the air, flowers are beginning to bloom, the clouds are starting to clear, and there’s a sense of invigoration after a long winter in the Northern Hemisphere . In the month of April, it’s no less impressive underwater, especially in regions that are coming to their peak.\nThe best diving destinations in April:\nApril is a great month for pelagics. Check out the Bahamas for tiger sharks or the Maldives for mantas . For whale shark encounters , the best diving locations are the Turks and Caicos Islands and Australia . Many locations in Southeast Asia offer phenomenal diving during April, such as the Philippines or Malaysia’s Sipadan Island , which experience their best conditions and marine life sightings during this month.\nIf you are thinking about traveling in April, plan ahead. April is one of the busiest months for travel due to Easter and Spring Breaks. If you leave booking to the last minute, availability may be limited, flight prices higher, and no great deals to be had.\nApril’s marine life highlight :\nFor whale sharks , Gladden Spit in Placencia , Belize, is one of the best places to dive in April. Sightings of the gentle giants peak between March and June. This is when the eggs released during the breeding season of two fishes (mutton snappers and groupers) provide a tasty feast for passing pelagics.\nRecommended course for April diving:\nFor many, April will be the first time they’ve dived in a while. The PADI ReActivate scuba refresher program can help you refresh your scuba skills and enjoy your underwater vacation safely. You can also take ReActivate online with PADI eLearning !\nLEARN MORE ABOUT DIVING IN APRIL\nMAY\nIf you’re wondering where to dive in May, there is no shortage of incredible options .\nThe best diving destinations in May:\nFrom dwarf minke whales and whale sharks in Australia to uncrowded dive sites in the Komodo Marine Park (Indonesia) , great diving can be found worldwide at this time of year.\nIf you are thinking about a liveaboard vacation , then May is the best time for pelagic encounters. In the Galapagos Islands , whale shark season is just beginning, and it’s still early enough to enjoy calm conditions. Meanwhile, the shift to the Southwest Monsoon brings high concentrations of manta rays to the Maldives .\nIf cavern diving is something you are hoping to tick off your bucket list, the Cenotes in Mexico have the best visibility during the year’s fifth month. May also offers the best weather in the Tuamotu Archipelago and French Polynesia .\nMay’s marine life highlight:\nMay is technically the end of liveaboard season in Socorro , Mexico. However, with summer on the horizon and water temperature increasing, it also offers the best chance to see giant oceanic manta rays congregate with sharks around this remote volcanic paradise.\nRecommended course for May diving:\nHowever, it should be noted that many of these best diving destinations for May require a hefty amount of drift diving. Why not prepare in advance by taking the PADI Drift Diver course ? Not only will you have more comfortable dives, but you’ll also have more confidence!\nLEARN MORE ABOUT DIVING IN MAY\nJUNE\nFor an unforgettable scuba trip in June, consider a destination filled with whale sharks and humpback whales , or explore some of the world’s best wreck diving.\nThe best diving destinations in June:\nIf you’re planning a diving vacation in June and want to dive with manta rays , then Hanifaru Bay in the Baa Atoll of the Maldives is incredible at this time of year. Due to the Southwest Monsoon, there is super-plankton-rich water that attracts filter feeders , including manta rays and whale sharks .\nIf you’re seeking a world-class wreck diving destination, the season in Bikini Atoll runs from May to September and is at its peak in June. There are dozens of wrecks, including the famous USS Saratoga .\nPapua New Guinea and the Bismarck Sea are also at their prime in June. Likewise, if you head to the Galapagos Islands , you’ll encounter humpback whales and whale sharks .\nJune’s marine life highlight :\nAlso hot in June is the famous Sardine Run in South Africa that takes place during a small window from May to July. This annual phenomenon attracts pelagic lovers and adrenaline-loving divers from around the world! Be warned, though. Places fill up fast, so be sure to book well in advance.\nRecommended course for June diving:\nBoat diving is the name of the game in most of the best diving destinations for June, so check out the PADI Boat Diver certification to learn boat diving etiquette ,\nterminology, and important do’s and don’ts.\nLEARN MORE ABOUT DIVING IN JUNE\nJULY\nIf you’re planning a trip, there’s really no wrong choice when deciding between the best places to dive in July.\nThe best diving destinations in July:\nAustralia is well known for its fantastic year-round diving. However, from June to November, it experiences winter and slightly cooler temperatures on the  Great Barrier Reef that attract  manta rays , whale sharks, and minke whales.\nOther destinations offering marine megafauna in July are Cocos Island and Vanuatu . Cocos Island (in Costa Rica ) has plankton blooms from June to December which attracts schooling hammerhead sharks. Meanwhile, it’s peak season in Vanuatu, one of the best diving sites in the world for dugongs .\nIn July, the Komodo UNESCO World Heritage Site in Indonesia has cooler water temperatures resulting in phenomenal visibility, manta rays, sharks, and an abundance and diversity of marine life. Sipadan in Malaysia is also enjoying its best conditions at this time of year, along with the Mediterranean waters of Italy .\nJuly’s marine life highlight:\nOne of the best whale shark snorkeling experiences can be found in July at Isla Mujeres , Mexico. This is where the Gulf of Mexico meets the Caribbean, and it’s known for mass whale shark congregations . Nearby Cancun offers plenty of incredible diving, too!\nRecommended course for July diving:\nBefore you book your trip, though, think about your buoyancy . This will ensure you don’t damage the gorgeous coral reefs of Australia or scare away the marine life in Indonesia, Mexico, or Costa Rica. Take the PADI Peak Performance Buoyancy course and fine-tune your hovering and finning skills before you leave.\nLEARN MORE ABOUT DIVING IN JULY\nAUGUST\nAugust is packed with some awesome diving opportunities for thrill seekers .  \nThe best diving destinations in August:\nPelagic action runs high during the eighth month, with hammerheads schooling around Cocos Island in Costa Rica . Both The Azores and Madagascar are also hotspots for cetacean sightings. August promises phenomenal drift diving and the mola mola season around Nusa Penida in Bali, Indonesia , as well as around the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador .\nFor those who want to experience macro diversity in August, head to North Sulawesi (also in Indonesia), where you can enjoy the world’s best muck diving and underwater photography in the Lembeh Strait before heading to Bangka Island for pinnacles and reefs, followed by the epic wall dive sites of the Bunaken Marine Park . Three destinations in one trip!\nAugust’s weather is at its best in many destinations . The uncrowded paradise of the Solomon Islands is particularly balmy, while the peak of summertime in Europe provides a sunny backdrop for exploring Malta ‘s many wrecks and sea caves. Fiji offers some of the world’s best coral reefs , and during the eighth month, the visibility is stellar. Travel at this time of year to see the reefs in all of their magnificent glory.\nAugust’s marine life highlight :\nSouth Australia is usually famed for leafy seadragons . However, travel to Whyalla in August to witness a natural spectacle like no other. Thousands of migrating Australian giant cuttlefish come together to mate in a kaleidoscopic courtship display. This is one not to miss!\nRecommended course for August diving:\nAnd make sure you’re ready to take advantage of all those fantastic mega and macro sightings by getting your PADI Digital Underwater Photographer certification before departure. You wouldn’t want to miss out on any amazing shots!\nLEARN MORE ABOUT DIVING IN AUGUST\nSEPTEMBER\nSeptember is a shoulder season month for many destinations around the world. Shoulder seasons mark the transition from peak season to low season or vice versa.\nThe best diving destinations in September:\nWhen considering dive travel during September, Egypt cannot be overlooked. It offers calm sea conditions, abundant marine life, and is the best time to spot thresher sharks in the Red Sea . If you hope to see manta rays , September is also the best month for sightings in Fiji .\nFor big fish aficionados , the Galapagos Islands offers whale sharks, penguins , and mola mola . Be prepared, though, as sea temperatures are markedly cooler at 19-23°C (66-73°F) with frequent thermoclines. Alternatively, for warmer whale shark encounters , head to Cenderawasih Bay, one of the best diving destinations in Indonesia .\nSeptember’s marine life highlight :\nPlanning to explore within the USA ? Hawaii has a world-famous nightly symphony of manta rays that dance between divers in a magical underwater ballet performance — all natural, of course. The calmer conditions during peak season make September the best time to get your ticket.\nRecommended course for September diving:\nThe PADI Night Diver course can increase your opportunity to get in the water and enjoy the best night diving destinations in September. You’ll definitely want this certification if you plan a trip to Hawaii. The night diver certification is also essential for safe diving after dark in destinations around the world.\nLEARN MORE ABOUT DIVING IN SEPTEMBER\nOCTOBER\nOctober is a month of opportunities for scuba divers all around the globe.\nThe best diving destinations in October:\nAt this time of year, you can swim with hundreds of manta rays in the Maldives . It’s the start of manta season in Papua New Guinea , too, where warm, clear waters meet with uncrowded reefs .\nDuring October, you can get up close with sharks in the Seychelles , Philippines , or Sudan . It’s also one of the best months for spotting whale sharks in Omani waters . In Bali, Indonesia , migratory sharks such as tiger sharks and thresher sharks are more likely to be seen at this time of year.\nThere’s also great muck and wreck diving in Bonaire (one of the best dive destinations for beginners ) and playful sea lions to be found in Mexico .\nOctober’s marine life highlight :\nIf you are heading down under, you’ll be able to witness the incredible phenomenon of coral spawning on the inshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef . The inshore reefs usually start spawning between one and six nights after the first full moon in October. This is a rare and magical event to witness — not to be missed!\nRecommended course for October diving:\nBefore heading out on any self-guided dives in Bonaire or Australia, you’ll want to complete the PADI Underwater Navigator course . That way, you won’t get lost in unfamiliar surroundings. Your dive buddies will appreciate the fact you can navigate like a pro, and you’ll have extra confidence.\nLEARN MORE ABOUT DIVING IN OCTOBER\nNOVEMBER\nMany equatorial destinations are entering peak seasons and offering the most favorable dive conditions during November.\nThe best diving destinations in November:\nIn particular, islands in western Thailand (including the Similan Islands ) and the Red Sea are in their prime months. November is also midway into Palau ’s peak season, which offers shark diving, wrecks, and world-class soft coral reefs. Heavy currents draw in pelagic species such as manta rays, reef sharks, and sea turtles. The diving season in Raja Ampat , Indonesia , lasts from October to April. November has fewer rain showers and relatively smooth seas for great diving. Primarily dived by liveaboard , this means comfortable sailing as well as epic diving!\nIf you visit Ecuador this month, there is a chance to see whale sharks and mola mola in the waters of the Galapagos . Penguins and sea lions are also more active at this time due to colder sea temperatures. There are also pelagics aplenty at Cocos Island , Costa Rica .\nIs Hawaii calling you? If so, November is an impressive month to visit. In addition to humpback whales, November’s plankton-rich water attracts an array of large marine life , including whale sharks, sea turtles, sharks, and stingrays. Plus, the manta ray night dive is one of the most magnificent manta ray experiences to be found in the world.\nNovember’s marine life highlight :\nPalau is diveable year-round, but November is its peak season. It’s during this time that you’ll be able to see parrotfish spawning for a few weeks of the month. Some liveaboards even run special trips to help divers observe this natural occurrence.\nRecommended course for November diving:\nAs many of the best scuba diving destinations for November lend themselves to liveaboard diving, we recommend enrolling in the PADI Equipment Specialist course before your trip. That way, should your scuba equipment need a basic repair, your dream vacation won’t be entirely derailed.\nLEARN MORE ABOUT DIVING IN NOVEMBER\nDECEMBER\nFor those living in the Northern Hemisphere, December often brings freezing temperatures . And let’s not forget the hail, snow, and long hours of darkness. However, things are starting to heat up in other parts of the world!\nThe best diving destinations in December:\nThe southern atolls of the Maldives and the Red Sea in Egypt offer fantastic shipwreck and shark diving during December . Wreck diving in Chuuk Lagoon must also be mentioned on your list of potential tropical getaway destinations.\nIf you prefer to head off the beaten track, topping a liveaboard in Myanmar during December is hard. Burma Banks and the Mergui Archipelago offer a glimpse of unspoiled reefs. This region is also home to schools of devil rays, nurse sharks, occasional whale sharks, and manta rays. There is also impressive macro life , including frogfish and a host of crustaceans, cephalopods, and nudibranchs .\nDecember’s marine life highlight :\nFor those who prefer to embrace the cold , why not explore thousands of islands, deep fjords, wrecks, and abundant marine life in Norway . December is the month that brings in pods of orcas and humpback whales that patrol the coastline. Bonus points if you also witness the Northern Lights !\nRecommended course for December diving:\nIf you plan to use December to explore one of these amazing wreck diving destinations, consider using your vacation to complete the PADI Wreck Diver certification.

Indeed, much of the region spans the Coral Triangle – home to 75% of the world’s coral species and over 6,000 fish species. What’s more, in addition to bucket-list marine life, you’ll find intriguing WWII shipwrecks in the Philippines and thrilling drift dives in Komodo.\nWithout a doubt, this corner of our blue planet should be on every diver’s bucket list. Keep reading for our picks of the best diving destinations in Southeast Asia.\n1. Cebu, Philippines\nIn the central region of the Philippines, Cebu will certainly delight beginners and advanced divers alike, with dazzling reefs, dramatic walls, exciting wrecks, gentle shore dives, and fast-paced drift diving. Along the way, you might come across sharks, eagle rays, dolphins, batfish, sweetlips, cuttlefish, and seahorses. Unlike its South African counterpart, you can also witness Moalboal’s spectacular sardine bait balls throughout the year.\nHowever, the jewel in Cebu’s crown is undoubtedly Malapascua Island . This is one of the world’s top shark diving destinations and is celebrated for its reliable, year-round sightings of thresher sharks at Monad Shoal’s cleaning station.\nCebu Dive Guide\nView All Dive Resorts in Cebu\n2. Raja Ampat, Indonesia\nAn eastern Indonesian gem, Raja Ampat is famed for its unspoiled biodiversity. Nutrient-rich currents flow through the Dampier Strait, where Cape Kri holds the record for the most fish species seen during a single dive . As a result, this is one of the world’s best dive sites .\nThe reefs here are teeming with vibrant corals and fish. Peek under ledges and inside crevices, and you might catch a glimpse of rarer species, such as wobbegong sharks , epaulette sharks , or pygmy seahorses.\nThe ideal way to explore Raja Ampat’s array of islands and reefs is by liveaboard , with peak season falling between October and April.\nRaja Ampat Dive Guide\nView All Liveaboards in Raja Ampat\n3. Sipadan, Malaysia\nAround an hour’s boat ride from Borneo lies the pelagic paradise of Sipadan Island . It’s the only oceanic island in Malaysia , where volcanic topography combined with ancient coral gardens and 50m (164ft) visibility make for some of the most breathtaking dive sites in Southeast Asia.\nBarracuda Point is a photographer’s favorite, where gigantic schools of barracuda form iconic vortexes . Meanwhile, Hanging Garden is marked by staggering walls that plunge over 600m (2,000ft) deep. You can also expect to see several shark species , turtles, triggerfish, eels, and octopuses. If that’s not enough, the muck diving hotspots of Mabul and Kapalai aren’t far away.\nSipadan offers some of the best diving in Southeast Asia throughout the year. However, it’s a permit-only destination, so book early to avoid disappointment.\nSipadan Dive Guide\nView All Dive Resorts in Sipadan\n4. Gili Islands, Indonesia\nNorth of Lombok , you’ll find three small islands characterized by laid-back vibes and impressive-yet-easy diving for everyone. Indeed, with its diverse range of sheltered sites, the Gili Islands is one of the best diving destinations in Southeast Asia for beginners .\nWith regular appearances by their namesakes, you won’t want to miss out on the epic dive sites known as Shark Point, Manta Point, and Turtle Heaven. What’s more, with countless hawksbill and green turtles, the Gili Islands is the “turtle capital of the world” . The area is also home to a plethora of critters, such as octopuses, scorpionfish, pipefish, mantis shrimp, and ribbon eels.\nBook your trip between September and November, when it’s not too busy with tourists but the weather is still excellent.\nGili Islands Dive Guide\nView All Dive Resorts in the Gili Islands\n5. Timor-Leste\nAfter gaining independence from Indonesia in 2002, Timor-Leste (aka East Timor) is Southeast Asia’s newest country . Its diving infrastructure is still developing, but this off-the-beaten track destination promises an uncrowded, unspoiled haven above and below the surface. In 2023, to encourage tourism, the NRDTL Kamanasa shipwreck was sunk to create an artificial, easily accessible reef.\nOne of the most popular scuba diving destinations is Atauro Island . Here, amid crystal-clear visibility, you can explore rugged seascapes paved with gorgonians, where turtles, dugongs, whitetip reef sharks, and pods of dolphins might pass by. Visit from September to November and you could even spot migrating whales , including the mighty blue .\nTimor-Leste Dive Guide\nView All Dive Trips in Timor-Leste\nPhoto Credit: PADI AmbassaDiver Bo Mancao\n6. Palawan, Philippines\nThe western Filipino destination of Palawan is packed full of kaleidoscopic coral reefs, tropical fish, and pelagic visitors, such as whale sharks .\nIn particular, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Tubbataha Reefs is an open-ocean site where strong currents draw in sharks, dolphins, mantas, turtles, whales, and over 600 fish species. Meanwhile, Coron Bay is world famous for its wreck diving, with a Japanese fleet of WWII shipwrecks and their weaponry lying 10-40m (30-130ft) deep.\nYou can only access Tubbataha Reefs by liveaboard between March and June, so book during this time to get the most from your Palawan trip.\nPalawan Dive Guide\nView All Dive Resorts in Palawan\n7. Similan Islands, Thailand\nNestled in the Andaman Sea , the Similan Islands offer some of the best scuba diving in Southeast Asia. Granite boulders, white beaches, and lush rainforests are surrounded by calm, azure waters and exceptional coral reefs.\nThe Similan Islands are open from October to May . However, plan your visit between December and April for the greatest chance of seeing the seasonal whale sharks and manta rays . Other underwater residents you can see year-round include ghost pipefish, nudibranchs, mantis shrimp , numerous sharks (including blacktip, whitetip, and leopard), barracuda, snappers, and four species of turtle.\nThailand Dive Guide\nView All Liveaboards in Thailand\n8. Komodo, Indonesia\nThis UNESCO World Heritage Site blends exhilarating adventure with abundant marine life and perfect conditions. Komodo is known for its dragons, but beneath the surface you can encounter barracuda, moray eels, turtles, dugongs, and hammerhead sharks. In addition, you’ll likely be surrounded by several manta rays while diving Manta Point.\nAlthough there are plenty of beginner-friendly sites, Komodo really comes into its own for seasoned divers. Strong currents rush along the many walls and canyons, creating a drift divers ‘ playground at sites such as Siaba Kecil.\nYou can dive Komodo year-round , but April to November is considered the best time to visit.\nKomodo Dive Guide\nView All Liveaboards in Komodo\nDiscover the Best Diving Destinations in Southeast Asia\nLooking for the best diving destinations in Southeast Asia and the Coral Triangle?

Underwater photographers, dive junkies, and adventurous travelers are all sure to enjoy diving here.\nWithout further ado, below are the five best diving destinations in South America .\n1. Galápagos Islands, Ecuador\nThe Galápagos Islands were made for lovers of marine life. Here you’ll find both accessible and remote dive sites, protected areas and strong currents – something for every level of diver.\nAs one of the best diving destinations in South America, diving in the Galápagos is not only exceptionally beautiful but also a rare treat. A UNESCO World Heritage site located almost 600 miles (1,000km) away from mainland Ecuador, the Galápagos Islands have a unique ecosystem found nowhere else in the world, as documented by Charles Darwin in his study of evolution.\nThe most popular dive spots are Darwin Island and Wolf Island , which have one of the world’s largest populations of sharks , rays, turtles, and whale sharks . You adon’t want to miss Roca Redonda either, where there’s an underwater volcano home to more sharks and sea lions .\nBecause of the Galápagos’ delicate biodiversity, the area is a very popular destination for scuba divers and general travelers alike. Most people who visit the islands opt to explore them on a liveaboard. To secure your spot, plan your dive trip well in advance.\nGalápagos Islands Dive Guide\nLiveaboards in the Galapagos\n2. Colombia\nColombia  is the only country in Latin America that has coastlines on both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, giving divers access to the best of both worlds.\nOn the Caribbean side , you’ll find the third largest barrier reef in the world . Diving highlights include Santa Marta , San Andrés and Providencia, where the calm, shallow waters are perfect for beginners. For the more experienced divers, there are also drift dives and wrecks.\nOn the Pacific side , you’ll find hammerheads, manta rays, whale sharks, and other pelagics. For the best dive experiences, head to Malpelo Island . Accessible only via liveaboard, this marine protected area has epic drift and deep dives that are only suitable for experienced Advanced Open Water Divers .\nColombia Dive Guide\nLiveaboards in Colombia\n3. Venezuela\nAdmittedly, the diving scene in Venezuela has flown under the radar for years, but Venezuela has the longest coastline on the Caribbean Sea of any country in South America. As such, it has hundreds of islands, cays, and marine parks with clear waters, healthy coral formations, and a huge variety of marine species. You can see tropical fish, nurse sharks, sea turtles, and even manta rays .\nThe best place to dive in Venezuela is Los Roques National Park . Known for its picture-perfect dive sites, this archipelago is easily considered one of the best diving destinations in South America. With something for everyone, Venezuela flaunts shallow reefs, steep coral walls, and huge underwater mountains.\nVenezuela Dive Guide\nDive Centers in Venezuela\n4. Brazil\nBrazil ’s extensive coastline on the Atlantic Ocean means there’s a huge variety of dive sites to explore. As a reflection of Brazil’s rich ecosystem, every dive site has different visibility levels, water temperatures, and underwater attractions.\nThe must-see dive destination in Brazil is Fernando de Noronha . It’s considered a diver’s paradise not only in South America but worldwide. With different dive sites for divers of all experience levels, this volcanic archipelago boasts near-perfect visibility, vibrant reefs, and colorful marine life, including spinner dolphins and sea turtles.\nFor wreck diving , Recife is the place to visit. It has over 100 wrecks and is therefore a window into Brazil’s historical and cultural tapestry. The wrecks date from the 16th century through to WWII. There are also some more recent artificial reefs .\nBrazil Dive Guide\nDive Trips in Brazil\n5. Chile\nFor the adventurous diver , Chile ’s Pacific coastline is dotted with some of South America’s best dive sites. Water temperatures range between 57°-70°F (14°-21°C), so you’ll need a drysuit to dive in Chile.\nThe biggest draw here is Easter Island (aka Rapa Nui), where excellent visibility allows you to enjoy the remote island’s pristine coral reefs and volcanic rock formations in all their primal beauty. Another top diving spot is Quintay , where there are shallow wrecks and wall dives.\nEven shore dives from the mainland in Chile show an incredible display of marine life, including kelp forests , sea lions, sea urchins, and starfish. And high up in the Andes Mountains, you’ll find high-altitude lake diving , too.\nChile Dive Guide\nDive Trips in Chile\nReady to Dive in South America?\nIf South America’s divers dive sites are calling to you, plan and organize your dive trip using PADI Travel , where you can easily find and book your trip. There are hundreds of liveaboards, dive resorts and dive centers waiting to show you the wonders of the underwater world across this continent.\nDive in South America – Start Planning Your Trip\nYou Might Also Like\nThe Best Dive Destinations in the Caribbean\nThe Best Dive Sites in North and South America\nThe Marine Life of the Galápagos\nShare This\nPosted in Travel\nTagged dive travel , scuba diving , South America , Travel\nRead More\nThe 10 Best Diving Destinations in Europe\nThe Best Diving Destinations in the Middle East\nRelated Posts\nPADI Club Trips: One of the Best Benefits of PADI Club Membership\nThe 10 Best Diving Destinations in Europe\nRegenerative Travel vs. Sustainable Travel: What’s the Difference?\nFind a Dive Center or Resort\nReplace Your Certification Card\nGet Dive Insurance\nBook a Scuba Vacation\nBuy Branded Merchandise\nDownload the Mobile App\nInside PADI\nWho We are\nThe PADI Difference\nOur History\nCorporate Responsibility\nWorking at PADI\nCorporate Information\nCompany Statistics\nPress\nOur Partners\nAdvertise with Us\nPADI AWARE\nAWARE Foundation\nPADI AWARE FAQs\nHistory & Impact\nDonate\nPADI Dive Center & Resorts\nWhy Partner with PADI?\nDive Center & Resort Levels\nStarting Your Own Scuba Business\nBusiness Planning Help\nHow Long Does It Take?\nBecome a Retailer or Resort\nRegional Support\nEMAIL UPDATES\nSign up to get the latest updates, offers and more.\nSIGN UP\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n©2024 PADI\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility\nCopyright\nForms Center\nContact\n"},

There are only very few other places in the world where you can get such great diving at such an affordable price. Almost all of the dive sites here are amazing and you can see anything from little critters to larger pelagics, wrecks, and anything in between.\nWhile the best dive sites in the Red Sea are found on other tours like Brothers – Daedalus – Elphinstone , or Deep South , the North tours are perfect for inexperienced divers.\nYou might not see a whale shark, oceanic white-tip, or manta ray here, however, the North is famous for its many wrecks, dolphins, and colorful reefs. And yes, you can also see reef sharks!\nThe Red Sea Aggressor II offers a cool Northern Red Sea tour with 21 dives that includes some of the best wrecks in the world like the S.S. Thislegorm!\nIn comparison to the South tours that usually require 50+ dives, you can find many dive boat operators that will let you join with as little as 30 dives, like on the All Star Luxury !\nAnd since the North tours are usually between 20-25 dives long…you’ll be at 50 dives in no time.\nDiving facts for liveaboard diving in the Red Sea, Egypt\nDiving Season Year-round Best time to dive May – November What to see Sharks, dolphins, dolphins, turtles. Many shipwrecks. Water Temperature 18-28°C (65-82°F) Best for Variety of dive spots, lots to see, very affordable Difficulty Easy. Mostly shallow, easy diving, reefs & easy to dive wrecks Recommended duration 7 nights\nDiving facts for liveaboard diving in the Red Sea, Egypt.\nBook on Liveaboard.com with a price guarantee\nBook on Allstar Liveaboards with shark week option\nBook with us & get personal support\nSimilan Islands, Thailand\nThe Similan Islands are great for beginner divers with mostly easy dive spots.\nThe Similan Islands in the Andaman Sea in Thailand is a great diving destination for beginners and the liveaboard cruises here are perfect for new divers.\nAs a matter of fact, my first liveaboard diving cruise was on the Manta Queen 1 in Thailand so I can attest to its beginner-friendliness.\nLiveaboard dive trips in Thailand are on the shorter side between 3-5 nights while still getting in between 18-25 dives! Yes, some tours include 5 dives a day. 🤩\nRichelieu Rock is often named one of the 10 best dive spots in the world and was first discovered by Jacques-Yves Cousteau. As it is too far off the coast for normal dive boats, this spectacular dive site can only be reached by liveaboard.\nWhat makes Thailand an optimal beginner liveaboard diving destination are the super low prices and the chance of seeing whale sharks, manta rays, and loads of fish.\nDiving facts for liveaboard diving in the Similan Islands, Thailand\nDiving Season November – April Best time to dive December – March What to see Manta rays, whale sharks, Mola Molas, an abundance of macro life Water Temperature 28-30°C (82-87°F) Best for There’s so.much.fish. Difficulty Mostly easy diving. Some negative descents Recommended duration 3-7 nights.\nDiving facts for liveaboard diving in the Similan Islands, Thailand.\nBook on Liveaboard.com with price guarantee\nBook with us & get personal support\nGreat Barrier Reef, Australia\nThe Great Barrier Reef is one of the most famous travel destinations in the world.\nThe Great Barrier Reef in Australia needs no introduction as it is arguably the most famous reef in the entire world. Even if you are just snorkeling instead of scuba diving, it’s a must-see!\nIt has become a topic of hot discussion in recent years, as coral bleaching endangers the area, however, the outer reef is still a great dive spot.\nDiving here is mostly easy and liveaboard diving tours are very beginner-friendly.\nSince the reef begins right under the water surface, there is no need to go super deep which is another reason the Great Barrier Reef is nice for beginner liveaboard divers.\nUnlike many other destinations on this list, almost all liveaboard tours here are snorkeling-friendly, too, like the Spirit of Freedom !\nDiving facts for liveaboard diving at Great Barrier Reef, Australia\nDiving Season Year-round Best time to dive June – December What to see Everything. 1,400km of dive sites, humpback whales, minke whales, manta rays, sharks, whale sharks, and cuttlefish, besides coral reefs, wrecks, and anything a diver could want. Water Temperature 30°C (86°F) in the summer (Dec-Feb) ~24°C (75°F) in the winter Best for Beautiful underwater world Difficulty Any level of diving available Recommended duration 3-7 nights.\nDiving facts for liveaboard diving at Great Barrier Reef.\nBook on Liveaboard.com with price guarantee\nBook with us & get personal support\nVisayas & Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park, Philippines\nThe Tubbataha natural park can only be dived on liveaboards like the Infiniti .\nThe Philippines are a great liveaboard diving destination and optimal for scuba divers, snorkelers, and backpackers.\nThere are two hotspots for liveaboard diving in the Philippines: The Visayas & the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park\nThe latter is actually part of my list of the 10 best liveaboard diving spots in the world, but the Visayas area is even better for a first-time liveaboard.\nBoth areas are well protected and offer beautiful intact reefs, lots of fish, and even whale sharks and manta rays.\nIf you don’t want to have to choose between the two, why not book a cruise that includes both areas, like the All Star Infiniti , the only dive boat in the Philippines with a RINA certification.\nA good alternative is also the Seadoors which offers slightly different tours.\nDiving facts for liveaboard diving in the Philippines\nDiving Season March – June Best time to dive The Natural Park is only open from March – June What to see Countless dive sites, whale sharks, manta rays, even whales in the winter Water Temperature 27-28°C (81-84°F) in the winter, 28-30°C (83-86°F) in the summer Best for Beautiful underwater world Difficulty Any level of diving available Recommended duration 7 nights.\nDiving facts for liveaboard diving in the Philippines.\nBook on Liveaboard.com with price guarantee\nBook on Allstar Liveaboards with RINA certification\nBook with us & get personal support\nBahamas\nThe Tubbataha natural park can only be dived on liveaboards like the Infiniti .\nThe Bahamas are the third-largest offshore barrier reef and a popular diving destination, especially among US divers.\nThey are easy to get to with direct flights from the US, Canada, the UK and the EU.\nDiving conditions here are easy and optimal for beginners with clear, warm water and only light currents.\nThis also makes it a great spot for freedivers, although snorkeling in general is not possible around larger sharks.\nSpeaking of sharks, the Bahamas are one of the few spots on earth where you can be ~100% sure to encounter tiger sharks!\nMost dives are shallow with maximum depths of 18-20m (65ft), however, you can also find some deeper walls and cliffs to dive.\nIf you have always wanted to dive with sharks, but are a little afraid to, check out my book “ Scuba Diving without Fear ” to learn how to overcome your fears and enjoy shark diving!\nDiving facts for liveaboard diving in the Bahamas\nDiving Season Year-round Best time to dive May – July has the highest shark encounter rate for Blacknose sharks What to see Sharks…so many sharks! Tiger sharks, hammerheads, reef shark, blacknose sharks… Water Temperature 22-30°C (72-88°F) Best for Shark diving!!! Difficulty Easy to intermediate, but be aware…there are sharks. 😉 Recommended duration 6 – 10 nights.\nDiving facts for liveaboard diving in the Bahamas.\nBook on Liveaboard.com with price guarantee\nBook on Allstar Liveaboards with RINA certification\nBook with us & get personal support\nWhat is the minimum number of dives required for liveaboard diving?\nThere is no fixed minimum number of dives before you can join a liveaboard diving cruise and instead dive boat operators set their own requirements. Some cruises can be done with less than 30 dives, however, more difficult tours may require 50 or even 100 minimum dives.\nAs liveaboard diving is often advanced with dive spots at open sea or with strong currents, the more experience you have scuba diving, the better.\nFreshly certified Open Water Divers, as well as inexperienced divers with less than 20-30 dives, should first do more shore-based diving or day trips, before going on a full liveaboard diving safari.\nIn my eyes, the absolute minimum number of dives should be around 30, however, there are good reasons why 50 is required by most dive boat operators.\nLiveaboard diving is far more advanced than shore diving at an easy house reef and requires solid diving skills.\nTherefore, get your Advanced Open Water Diver certificate first, and go on at least one shore diving trip with a few more guided dives before even considering a liveaboard dive trip. You’ll thank me later.\nOf course, there is nothing holding you back from booking a tour sooner, but experience shows that the more dives you have the better.\nHow to choose a liveaboard diving cruise for beginners\nLook for a destination with easy diving conditions with little to no currents, shallow dive sites, and warm, clear water. It can help to book with a tour operator that offers personal support and has dive guides onboard who can safely lead beginners on their dives. Check the tour schedule in advance and find out what others say about the included dive spots.\nChoosing a liveaboard diving tour for beginners can be tricky, especially when you haven’t been to the place before.\nA suitable cruise also depends on what constitutes a “beginner” in your case.\nInexperienced divers\nAre you an inexperienced diver in general with only few dives? Consider diving more from shore or zodiac before joining a full-blown cruise.\nAlternatively, go liveaboard diving at a destination you have been to before, maybe even the one you did your course at. This way, you know the diving conditions, how much weight you need , and how to have good buoyancy at that place.\nSome tour operators have dive schools attached which is always a good sign that they know the needs of inexperienced divers.\nNo prior boat experience\nOn the other hand, if you have done 50+ dives, but never gone boat diving , you can choose more advanced liveaboard diving tours.\nIn this case, I suggest finding something that has easy entries and exits, but you probably won’t be bothered if there are more currents or deeper dive sites.\nConclusion\nThis concludes our list of the best beginner liveaboard diving destinations 2024.\nAs you see, it is a little shorter than other best-off lists we have made, however, we will update it once we have found (and TESTED!) other suitable dive spots.\nMake sure to download our scuba diving trip packing list before going on a liveaboard cruise and check for current liveaboard deals !\nOh, and if boat or shark diving scares you, check out my book “ Scuba Diving without Fear ” to learn how to overcome your fears and enjoy diving even more!\nJoin the email list to get regular diving tips, tricks, insights, and news straight to your inbox!\nAlways dive with friends and happy bubbles. 😃\nCheers\nJulius\n5 Best Beginner Liveaboard Diving Destinations 2024\nBest Beginner Liveaboard Diving Destinations\nWhat is the minimum number of dives required for liveaboard diving?\nHow to choose a liveaboard diving cruise for beginners\nConclusion\nFREE stuff\nThe ultimate scuba packing list\nGet the FREE scuba diving trip packing list and never go diving unprepared!\nDownload now\nCategories\nDive Travel\nDiving\nTravel\nRelated Topics\nKeep reading\nPost navigation\nPrevious\nPrevious\nScuba Diving and Swimming\nNext\nContinue\nWhere to book a dive trip in 2024 - The 7 best places\nAbout the author\nJulius\nHey!

The rich biodiversity of marine life has meant that very large swathes of Thailand’s coasts, open oceans and numerous islands qualify as a world heritage site – and they are a sight to behold.\nBy travelling to Thailand for your scuba diving holidays you will get the following brilliant benefits:\nEasy flights and connections : Even when you are travelling to some of the more remote sites in Thailand there is easy travel, with convenient connecting flights to very close dive sites. As a result, Thailand is an excellent destination if you are looking for a flexible, multi-destination trip.\nA Resort dive heaven : While a liveaboard experience into deep waters off of the Thai coast and swimming with whale sharks would enthral beginner and experienced divers alike, Thailand’s resort facilities means it serves as a perfect scuba diving destination in Asia for luxury, comfort and value.\nDiverse dive sites : You can do a reef dive to Thailand’s many coral reefs to view the vibrant reef fish and underwater landscape, view a wreck in the Andaman sea or simply take a shore dive if you fancy a swim with manta docile rays on Koh Bon on the Similan Islands – there’s an option for every type of dive you can imagine.\nYou can do it all in Thailand, and you can even make time to explore the country’s many cultural sites and local tourist attractions between dives – if desired. There is so much Thailand offers in terms of good food, warm people and a vibrant way of life – which is why it wins out as one of our best scuba diving destinations in Asia.\nScuba Diving Holidays in Indonesia\nAs a centrally-located country, right in the middle of the Coral Triangle, Indonesia is a compelling place for divers to visit. Budding underwater photographers can take advantage of the country’s crystal clear water and gentle currents, which are perfect for attracting a diverse range of placid marine life.\nBy choosing Indonesia as the location for your scuba diving holidays you will get the following advantages:\nPerfect diving conditions : One thing that Indonesia has is some of the best diving conditions seen in all of Asia. Even inexperienced divers can enjoy calm dive sites on famous islands such as Bunaken island. We have a great trip to Bunaken Oasis Dive Resort and Spa – offering 5-star luxury.\nAmazing scenery : The volcanic nature of Indonesia makes the underwater atmosphere magnetically compelling, and the above water landscape is beautiful. You are unlikely to find a more interesting location in terms of wall dives and cave dives, as the rock formations are unique to the region. \nTourist-friendly resorts : Although it is an extremely strict Islamic country for locals, Indonesia caters extremely well for foreign tourists.  Indonesia’s resorts and hotels offer the same standards as developed nations, meaning you can wear western clothing and even consume alcohol with no issues.\nThe geography of the region also makes Indonesia a good scuba diving destination in Asia for beginners, as the conditions are impressively calm. Indonesia is known as the pacific rim of fire due to its many active volcanoes, and it is a location also known for its intense spirit, local warmth and very spicy foods.\nImportant Information About Financial Protection\nWe are proud members of the Travel Trust Association.\nThe Travel Trust Association is a travel trade association. With 100% financial protection The Travel Trust Association exists to protect you, the customer, and they have been doing so for over 20 years. This means that any money you pay us is protected by the Travel Trust Association.\nWhat Type of Marine Life Can You See at Diving Destinations in Asia?\nThe abundance, variety and visually striking appeal of the marine life you can swim within Asia is a key part of its appeal. You can expect to see the following types of fish and other marine life while on scuba diving holidays in Asia, including in destinations such as  Indonesia or Thailand:\nAngelfish\nBannerfish\nBarracuda, including the chevron barracuda\nBatfish\nBlacktip reef sharks\nBryde’s whales\nBull shark\nButterflyfish\nClownfish\nCommon dolphins\nCoral trout\nDamsels\nDrummers\nEagle rays\nFilefish\nFusiliers\nGiant clams\nGiant octopus\nGroupers\nHammerhead shark\nHumpback whales\nHumphead parrotfish\nJacks\nLeopard sharks\nLionfish\nManatees, which are sometimes called dugongs\nManta rays\nMoray eels\nNudibranchs\nNurse sharks\nPilot whales\nPipefish\nPygmy seahorses\nRabbitfish\nRays, including blue-spotted ribbon tail rays and stingrays\nReef sharks\nSea hares\nSea snakes\nSeahorses\nSnappers\nSperm whales\nStonefish\nSunfish, which are sometimes called mola molas\nThresher sharks\nTiger sharks\nTrevally fusiliers\nTriggerfish\nSea turtles, including green and hawksbill turtles\nWhale sharks, at certain times of the year only\nWhitetip reef shark\nOverall Asia is one of the best scuba diving destinations on the planet due to the sheer variety of marine life on offer. Asia is a destination where you can see a lot in one go. For people travelling from most of the UK, Europe and North America the marine life is particularly unusual – offering something exotic for divers to explore.\nNot sure where you want to travel to?\nCompare diving locations and activities from all over the world, with our destination finder .\nTry our destination finder\nWhat Kind of Diving Conditions Can I Expect From Scuba Diving Holidays in Asia?\nAsia is a very large region, consisting of dozens of countries that offer many potential diving opportunities. As a result, there are major variations in the conditions you can expect – depending on the specific destination and the type of dive you undertake.\nAlthough there can be a considerable amount of variation between each dive site, the following are overall details on the conditions typical of many scuba diving destinations in Asia:\nTemperatures : The good news for temperature-sensitive divers is that most scuba diving holidays in Asia are in relatively warm waters. As a region that is fairly close to the equator, you can expect a low of around 19°C, but you will likely see warmer water temperatures throughout the region.\nCurrents : Open water dives naturally have much stronger currents, which means they are more appropriate for experienced divers. However, shore dives are generally very mild in terms of currents and wall or cave dives have the benefit of the regions sheltered position and calm archipelagos\nVisibility : The reason that countries like Thailand and Indonesia are some of the best scuba diving destinations in Asia is that much of it is protected through a strong national parks system, which results in excellent visibility. You can expect visibility of up to 30 meters, all year round.\nYou will have to avoid the rainy seasons, which generally occur over the summer, but overall the conditions are perfect for superb scuba diving holidays – no matter what destination in Asia you prefer. If you are worried about whether your skills will be up to scratch, you can simply take one of our accredited diving courses .\nBook a Diving Holiday to the Best Scuba Diving Destinations in Asia\nIt can be incredibly difficult to find a reliable provider of scuba diving holidays, in Asia or anywhere else.
