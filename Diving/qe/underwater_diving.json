The definitions listed are in the context of underwater diving. There may be other meanings in other contexts.\nSurface-supplied divers riding a stage to the underwater workplace\nUnderwater diving can be described as a human activity – intentional, purposive, conscious and subjectively meaningful sequence of actions. Underwater diving is practiced as part of an occupation, or for recreation, where the practitioner submerges below the surface of the water or other liquid for a period which may range between seconds to the order of a day at a time, either exposed to the ambient pressure or isolated by a pressure resistant suit, to interact with the underwater environment for pleasure, competitive sport, or as a means to reach a work site for profit, as a public service, or in the pursuit of knowledge, and may use no equipment at all, or a wide range of equipment which may include breathing apparatus, environmental protective clothing, aids to vision, communication, propulsion, maneuverability, buoyancy and safety equipment, and tools for the task at hand.\nMany of the terms are in general use by English speaking divers from many parts of the world, both amateur and professional, and using any of the modes of diving. Others are more specialised, variable by location, mode, or professional environment. There are instances where a term may have more than one meaning depending on context, and others where several terms refer to the same concept, or there are variations in spelling. A few are loan-words from other languages.\nThere are five sub-glossaries, listed here. The tables of content should link between them automatically:\nGlossary of underwater diving terminology: A–C\nGlossary of underwater diving terminology: D–G\nGlossary of underwater diving terminology: H–O\nGlossary of underwater diving terminology: P–S\nGlossary of underwater diving terminology: T–Z\nRetrieved from \" https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glossary_of_underwater_diving_terminology&oldid=1209972621 \"\nLast edited on 24 February 2024, at 11:12\nLanguages\nAfrikaans\nRomână\nThis page was last edited on 24 February 2024, at 11:12  (UTC) .\nContent is available under CC BY-SA 4.0 unless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout Wikipedia\nDisclaimers\nContact Wikipedia\nCode of Conduct\nDevelopers\nStatistics\nCookie statement\nTerms of Use\nDesktop\n",

Skin diving requires only a face mask or goggles, a short breathing tube (protruding from the mouth and kept above water), and flippers, or foot fins. A wet suit, a dry suit, or the latter over the former may be used in cold water. Skin diving was first popularized in the 1920s and ’30s in the Mediterranean and off the California coast, notably by the American diver Guy Gilpatric, whose The Compleat Goggler (1938) gave great impetus to the sport and aroused the interest of the French naval engineer and diver Jacques Cousteau . The goggles, flippers, snorkel (the name given the air tube from the German submarine air exhaust and intake device that allowed submerged operation), and face mask were all developed into their basic forms in the 1930s.\nBritannica Quiz\nAmerican Sports Nicknames\nAttempts to construct diving apparatus go back to the 19th century, but the sport of scuba, or Aqua-Lung, diving dates from 1943, when Cousteau and the French engineer Émile Gagnan developed the first fully automatic compressed-air Aqua-Lung. Cousteau also did important work on the development of underwater cameras and photography and popularized the sport in Le Monde du silence (1952; The Silent World ), written with Frédéric Dumas, and in other writings and television and film productions. Clubs formed after 1943 as fast as scuba equipment became available; national associations were formed in France, Italy , Great Britain, Canada, and the United States; and in 1959 Cousteau formed, with 15 national organizations (later more than 50), the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatique (CMAS; World Underwater Federation).\ncommon sea fan\nScuba diver viewing an orange-coloured common sea fan ( Gorgonia ventalina ) on the Great Barrier Reef near the coast of Australia.

An improved spear gun devised in the 1930s is used for food hunting , and special underwater cameras are widely used for recreational and scientific purposes. In addition, scuba diving has been useful scientifically in oceanography , in the study of fish and other marine organisms, and in the study of water pollution , as well as in the exploration of ships on the ocean floor and for salvage work, in which the earlier diving helmet with air line from on shipboard has been largely replaced.\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Robert Lewis .\n"},

For other uses, see Diving .\nUnderwater diving , as a human activity, is the practice of descending below the water's surface to interact with the environment. It is also often referred to as diving , an ambiguous term with several possible meanings, depending on context. Immersion in water and exposure to high ambient pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well-adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has been developed to extend the depth and duration of human dives, and allow different types of work to be done.\nSurface-supplied divers riding a stage to the underwater workplace\nIn ambient pressure diving, the diver is directly exposed to the pressure of the surrounding water. The ambient pressure diver may dive on breath-hold ( freediving ) or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving , and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range to full ocean depth , and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.\nThe environment exposes the diver to a wide range of hazards, and though the risks are largely controlled by appropriate diving skills , training , types of equipment and breathing gases used depending on the mode, depth and purpose of diving, it remains a relatively dangerous activity. Professional diving is usually regulated by occupational health and safety legislation, while recreational diving may be entirely unregulated. Diving activities are restricted to maximum depths of about 40 metres (130   ft) for recreational scuba diving, 530 metres (1,740   ft) for commercial saturation diving, and 610 metres (2,000   ft) wearing atmospheric suits. Diving is also restricted to conditions which are not excessively hazardous, though the level of risk acceptable can vary, and fatal incidents may occur.\nRecreational diving (sometimes called sport diving or subaquatics) is a popular leisure activity. Technical diving is a form of recreational diving under more challenging conditions. Professional diving (commercial diving, diving for research purposes, or for financial gain) involves working underwater. Public safety diving is the underwater work done by law enforcement, fire rescue, and underwater search and recovery dive teams. Military diving includes combat diving, clearance diving and ships husbandry . Deep sea diving is underwater diving, usually with surface-supplied equipment, and often refers to the use of standard diving dress with the traditional copper helmet. Hard hat diving is any form of diving with a helmet , including the standard copper helmet, and other forms of free-flow and lightweight demand helmets . The history of breath-hold diving goes back at least to classical times, and there is evidence of prehistoric hunting and gathering of seafoods that may have involved underwater swimming. Technical advances allowing the provision of breathing gas to a diver underwater at ambient pressure are recent, and self-contained breathing systems developed at an accelerated rate following the Second World War .\nHome About us FAQ Press Site map Terms of service Privacy policy\n"},

The definitions listed are in the context of underwater diving. There may be other meanings in other contexts.\nUnderwater diving can be described as a human activity – intentional, purposive, conscious and subjectively meaningful sequence of actions. Underwater diving is practiced as part of an occupation, or for recreation, where the practitioner submerges below the surface of the water or other liquid for a period which may range between seconds to the order of a day at a time, either exposed to the ambient pressure or isolated by a pressure resistant suit, to interact with the underwater environment for pleasure, competitive sport, or as a means to reach a work site for profit, as a public service, or in the pursuit of knowledge, and may use no equipment at all, or a wide range of equipment which may include breathing apparatus, environmental protective clothing, aids to vision, communication, propulsion, maneuverability, buoyancy and safety equipment, and tools for the task at hand.\nMany of the terms are in general use by English speaking divers from many parts of the world, both amateur and professional, and using any of the modes of diving. Others are more specialised, variable by location, mode, or professional environment. There are instances where a term may have more than one meaning depending on context, and others where several terms refer to the same concept, or there are variations in spelling. A few are loan-words from other languages.\nThere are five sub-glossaries, listed here. The tables of content should link between them automatically:\nGlossary of underwater diving terminology: A–C\nGlossary of underwater diving terminology: D–G\nGlossary of underwater diving

This could include Decompression (diving) , Diver rescue , Underwater searches , Underwater navigation , Underwater search and recovery , Underwater archaeology , Diver communications , Underwater surveys, inspection and testing etc. At a stretch these could go under \"Related\", but there are enough procedural aspects that a separate category is justifiable, Related should stay, as there will be the odd tenuous connection like Hyperbaric medicine that would fit there best.

If anyone has ideas of how to do this efficiently, please let me know. Otherwise I plan to progress by trying things out and see what works. Please point out any obvious errors or inconsistencies.

I propose to copy it over the old one if no-one can come up with a reason not to do it. There may be errors and omissions or details that can be improved. Those should be fixable.

I am not sure whether I understand the problem you were addressing, and it is not clear to me whether this is a solution (pun unfortunately unavoidable). What I do see is that if this is a real problem it will probably occur again and become more frequent as the encyclopedia grows, so it is worth looking into how effective your solution might be, and possibly into alternatives, so could you please explain the problem, and how this measure is a solution, taking into account any side effects it may have. Cheers, · · · Peter Southwood\n(talk) : 17:11, 24 June 2021 (UTC) Reply\nSee User talk:Wbm1058#Solution , Wikipedia talk:On Wikipedia, solutions are mixtures and nothing else#It's fine to use the meaning of solution to a problem and Talk:Solution#Rename this article to Solution (chemistry) as well as my recent edit history. The template was generating a lot of false-positive links and I did that, for the short term, to clear up the link fog to make my search for the \"solution selling\" links go quicker. – Best, wbm1058 ( talk ) 17: 50, 24 June 2021 (UTC)\nwbm1058 , I think I see your point. It is not the problem I was expecting, but a real problem nonetheless. I basically agree with the effort to clean up the mislinking of \"business solutions\" to chemical solutions, and as far as I know, all links to solution from diving related articles are related to chemical solutions, mostly of gases in body tissues, in case you were wondering, as that is central to decompression theory. I deal with an IT supplier called Complete Office Solutions, and the name always makes me think of ink... Cheers, · · · Peter Southwood\n(talk) : 06:13, 25 June 2021 (UTC) Reply\nP.S. On Wikipedia I tend to expect \"link spam\" to refer to external links, and \"overlinking\" when referring to unnecessary links on words that shouldn't need clarification in context, but maybe your experience differs. Anyway this is not really either. I wish you well on your link correction project, and will keep a lookout for examples, and fix any I notice.

Recreational dive sites are not about diving as an activity, they are instances of places where the activity occurs, in a similar way to how divers are instances of people who dive, not about the activity of diving, and both categories are very open ended, and will constantly grow, whereas articles about diving per se are relatively closely circumscribed. · · · Peter Southwood\n(talk) : 05:36, 20 August 2021 (UTC) Reply\nDiscuss:\nRecreational dive sites now all in separate navbox, {{ Recreational dive sites }}, along with a whole lot more that were not previously listed, so I will now remove the site and specific region listings from the main navbox. Some overlap will remain. · · · Peter Southwood\n(talk) : 15:42, 26 August 2021 (UTC) Reply\nAdd topic\nRetrieved from \" https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Underwater_diving&oldid=1127147881 \"\nLast edited on 13 December 2022, at 04:20\nLanguages\nThis page is not available in other languages.\nThis page was last edited on 13 December 2022, at 04:20  (UTC) .\nContent is available under CC BY-SA 4.0 unless otherwise noted.\nPrivacy policy\nAbout Wikipedia\nDisclaimers\nContact Wikipedia\nCode of Conduct\nDevelopers\nStatistics\nCookie statement\nTerms of Use\nDesktop\n"},

It is usually underwater , but professional diving is sometimes done in other liquids. Underwater diving is the human practice of voluntarily descending below the surface of the water to interact with the surroundings, for various recreational or occupational reasons, but the concept of diving also legally extends to immersion in other liquids, and exposure to other pressurised environments. [1] Some of the more common diving environments are listed and defined here.\nIce diving\nThe diving environment is limited by accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving is done in the shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect equipment configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. [2] Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. [3] Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team. [4]\nBenign conditions, sometimes also referred to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas. [5]\nOpen water is unrestricted water such as a sea, lake or flooded quarry , where the diver has unobstructed direct vertical access to the surface of the water in contact with the atmosphere. [6]\nOpen-water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air. [7]\nWall diving is done along a near vertical face. Blue-water diving is done in mid-water where the bottom is out of sight of the diver and there may be no fixed visual reference. [8]\nBlack-water diving is mid-water diving at night, particularly on a moonless night. [9] [10]\nAn overhead or penetration diving environment is where the diver enters a space from which there is no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving , wreck diving , ice diving and diving inside or under other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit. [11] [4] [3]\nNight diving can allow the diver to experience a different underwater environment , because many marine animals are nocturnal . [12]\nAltitude diving , for example in mountain lakes, requires modifications to the decompression schedule because of the reduced atmospheric pressure.

As a general rule, professional diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which are known for their convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions.\nRecreational dive sites  – Places that divers go to enjoy the underwater environment\nIndex of recreational dive sites  – Alphabetical listing of articles on porular places for recreational diving\nInland dive sites – Dive sites in bodies of water other than the sea\nCoastal dive sites – Dive sites near a coast of the body of water\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCoral reef  – Outcrop of rock in the sea formed by the growth and deposit of stony coral skeletons\nLake  – Large body of relatively still water\nMuck diving  – Recreational diving on a loose sedimentary bottom\nQuarry dive sites  – Disused and flooded quarry repurposed for underwater diving\nRocky reef  – Natural reef of rock\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nDiver training sites\nedit\nSee also: Diver training § Training venues for diving skills\nDiver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the environmental risk is relatively low. [15]\nSwimming pool  – Artificial water basin for swimming\nDiver training tank  – Tank of water to practice diving skills\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nHyperbaric treatment and transport environments\nedit\nPhysiologically and legally a compression in a diving chamber is considered a dive. Various options for hypebaric transport and treatment exist, each with its own characteristics, applications and operational procedures.\nClosed bell  – Hyperbaric chamber for transporting divers vertically through the water\nHyperbaric stretcher  – Portable pressure vessel to transport a person under pressure.\nHyperbaric lifeboat  – Lifeboat for transporting people under pressure\nIn-water recompression  – In-water treatment for decompression sickness\nRecompression chamber  – A hyperbaric chamber used to treat divers suffering from decompression illness\nEnvironments by confinement\nedit\nConfinement can influence diver safety and the ability of the diver to perform the required task. Some types of confinement improve safety by limiting the ability of the diver to move into higher risk areas, others limit the ability of the diver to maneuver or to escape to a place of safety in an emergency.\nConfined space  – Space with limited entry and egress and not suitable for human inhabitants\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training. The Queensland government define confined water for recreational diving purposes as \"Water which offers pool-like conditions, good visibility, and water which is shallow enough so that all divers can stand up with their heads well clear of the water\". [16] Other definitions do not require such shallow depth, but may have a depth restriction.\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nPenetration diving , also known as overhead environments – Diving under a physical barrier to a direct vertical ascent to the surface\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCavern diving  – Diving in the part of a cave where the exit is visible by natural light\nCulvert  – Structure to channel water past an obstacle\nIce diving  – Underwater diving under ice\nIntake  – Opening or structure through which a fluid is admitted into a space or machine\nPenstock  – Intake structure that controls water flow to turbines or sewerage systems\nOverhang  – Rocky part protruding from a cliff – A topographical feature which is open to one side, but obstructed overhead, and deep enough for a diver to be under the overhang.\nRestriction  – Space through which it is possible to pass with some difficulty – Space through which it is possible for a diver to pass with some difficulty. Section of a cave which is difficult to pass through due to lack of space. A minor restriction is too small for two divers to swim through together, a major restriction requires the diver to remove equipment to fit through. [17]\nSewerage  – Infrastructure that conveys sewage or surface runoff using sewers\nSwim-through  – Short underwater tunnel with adequate clearance and obvious exit – Arch, or short, clear tunnel that has sufficient space to allow a diver to swim through and where the light of the opening at the far end is visible through the hole.\nUnder ships – usually for inspection, maintenance and repair, or incidentally, when diving from one. In some cases the gap between the ship and the bottom or the jetty or dock can be quite small.\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nEnvironments by visibility\nedit\nVisibility in the diving medium directly affects diver safety and the ability to complete useful tasks. In some cases this can be mitigated by technology to improve visibility, but often the task procedures must be modified to suit the capacity of the diver, and the diver must have training and equipment bto deal with emergencies under more difficult circumstances.\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nLow visibility diving\nSilt out  – Reduction of underwater visibility by disturbing silt deposits\nNight diving  – Underwater diving during the hours of darkness\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nEnvironments by hazard\nedit\nBesides the hazards associated with the underwater environment itself, there are a considerable variety of hazard types and risk levels to which a diver may be exposed due to the circumstances of the dive task. Many of these are normally only encountered by professional specialists , and the means of reducing risk to an acceptable level may be complex and expensive.\nBenign water  – Diving environment with very low risk\nBomb disposal  – Activity to dispose of and render safe explosive munitions and other materials\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nCombat diving  – Tactical military scuba diving\nCurrents – Water flow in a locally consistent direction\nDelta P environments  – Hazards associated with underwater diving – Environments where a pressure difference causes flow.

[18] The recommended depth limit for more extensively trained recreational divers ranges from 30 metres (98 ft) for PADI divers, [19] (this is the depth at which nitrogen narcosis symptoms generally begin to be noticeable in adults), to 40 metres (130 ft) specified by Recreational Scuba Training Council , [19] 50 metres (160 ft) for divers of the British Sub-Aqua Club and Sub-Aqua Association breathing air, [20] and 60 metres (200 ft) for teams of 2 to 3 French Level 3 recreational divers, breathing air. [21]\nFor technical divers, the recommended maximum depths are greater on the understanding that they will use less narcotic gas mixtures. 100 metres (330 ft) is the maximum depth authorised for divers who have completed Trimix Diver certification with IANTD [22] or Advanced Trimix Diver certification with TDI . [23] 332 metres (1,089 ft) is the world record depth on scuba (2014). [24] Commercial divers using saturation techniques and heliox breathing gases routinely exceed 100 metres (330 ft), but they are also limited by physiological constraints. Comex Hydra 8 experimental dives reached a record open water depth of 534 metres (1,752 ft) in 1988. [25] Atmospheric pressure diving suits are mainly constrained by the technology of the articulation seals, and a US Navy diver has dived to 610 metres (2,000 ft) in one. [26] [27]\nFrom an oceanographic viewpoint:\nShallow water, defined as between the surf-zone and the coast\nIntermediate water, defined as between the surf zone and wave base (where the waves just interact with the bottom and no more, usually about 80 m water depth with 10 second swells). The seafloor beneath intermediate water is termed the shoreface and is the zone where the seafloor slows down the swells by friction, so that the surf ends up being lower than it otherwise would be.\nDeep water, defined as deeper than wave base: i.e. too deep for waves to interact with the seafloor.\nRecreational divers will usually dive in the shallow to intermediate marine environment. Technical and commercial divers may venture into the deep water environment.\nEnvironments by professional activity\nedit\nSee also: Professional diving\nAquaculture  – Farming of aquatic organisms\nAquarium  – Transparent tank of water for fish and water-dwelling species\nArchaeological sites  – Place in which evidence of past activity is preserved\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nDeep sea mining , also known as Underwater mining – Mineral extraction from the ocean floor\nDemolition  – Tearing-down of buildings and other structures\nDry dock  – Basin drained to allow work on a vessel\nFish farms  – Raising fish commercially in enclosures\nForensic investigation  – Application of scientific investigation to criminal and civil laws\nInspection  – Organized examination or formal evaluation exercise\nMarine salvage  – Recovering a ship or cargo after a maritime casualty\nMilitary  – Organization primarily tasked with preparing for and conducting war\nMooring  – Structure for securing floating vessels\nSingle buoy mooring , also known as Single point mooring – Offshore mooring buoy with connections for loading or unloading tankers\nNuclear power plant  – Thermal power station where the heat source is a nuclear reactor\nOil rig  – Apparatus constructed for oil drilling\nOil platform , also known as Production platform – Offshore ocean structure with oil drilling and related facilities\nPublic safety diving  – Underwater work done by law enforcement, rescue and search and recovery teams\nScience  – Systematic endeavor for gaining knowledge\nSearch and rescue  – Search for and provision of aid to people who are in distress or imminent danger\nSewage treatment  – Process of removing contaminants from municipal wastewater\nShips husbandry  – Maintenance and upkeep of ships\nSubmarine pipeline  – Pipeline that is laid on the seabed or below it inside a trench\nSurveying  – Science of determining the positions of points and the distances and angles between them\nTraining  – Acquisition of knowledge, skills, and competencies as a result of teaching or practice\nUnderwater construction , also known as Civil engineering – Industrial construction in an underwater environment\nWellhead  – Component at the surface of a well that provides the structural and pressure-containing interface\nDiving medium\nedit\nUnderwater environment  – Aquatic or submarine environment\nFresh water  – Naturally occurring water with low amounts of dissolved salts\nPotable water  – Water safe for consumption\nBrackish water  – Water with salinity between freshwater and seawater\nSeawater  – Water from a sea or an ocean\nBrine  – Concentrated solution of salt in water\nContaminated water  – Water containing high levels of hazardous materials\nSewage  – Wastewater that is produced by a community of people\nDrilling fluid , also known as drilling mud – Aid for drilling boreholes into the ground\nPetroleum , also known as crude oil – Naturally occurring flammable liquid\nFuel oil  – Petroleum product burned to generate motive power or heat\nReferences\nedit\n^\nDiving Regulations 2009 .

This could include Decompression (diving) , Diver rescue , Underwater searches , Underwater navigation , Underwater search and recovery , Underwater archaeology , Diver communications , Underwater surveys, inspection and testing etc. At a stretch these could go under \"Related\", but there are enough procedural aspects that a separate category is justifiable, Related should stay, as there will be the odd tenuous connection like Hyperbaric medicine that would fit there best.

I am not sure whether I understand the problem you were addressing, and it is not clear to me whether this is a solution (pun unfortunately unavoidable). What I do see is that if this is a real problem it will probably occur again and become more frequent as the encyclopedia grows, so it is worth looking into how effective your solution might be, and possibly into alternatives, so could you please explain the problem, and how this measure is a solution, taking into account any side effects it may have.

It is not the problem I was expecting, but a real problem nonetheless. I basically agree with the effort to clean up the mislinking of \"business solutions\" to chemical solutions, and as far as I know, all links to solution from diving related articles are related to chemical solutions, mostly of gases in body tissues, in case you were wondering, as that is central to decompression theory.

On Wikipedia I tend to expect \"link spam\" to refer to external links, and \"overlinking\" when referring to unnecessary links on words that shouldn't need clarification in context, but maybe your experience differs. Anyway this is not really either. I wish you well on your link correction project, and will keep a lookout for examples, and fix any I notice.

[ edit ]\nI am considering splitting out the list of recreational dive sites in the same way as underwater divers, and just keeping the generic articles as a summary, for a similar reason. Recreational dive sites are not about diving as an activity, they are instances of places where the activity occurs, in a similar way to how divers are instances of people who dive, not about the activity of diving, and both categories are very open ended, and will constantly grow, whereas articles about diving per se are relatively closely circumscribed. · · · Peter Southwood\n(talk) : 05:36, 20 August 2021 (UTC) [ reply ]\nDiscuss:\nRecreational dive sites now all in separate navbox, {{ Recreational dive sites }}, along with a whole lot more that were not previously listed, so I will now remove the site and specific region listings from the main navbox.

It is usually underwater , but professional diving is sometimes done in other liquids. Underwater diving is the human practice of voluntarily descending below the surface of the water to interact with the surroundings, for various recreational or occupational reasons, but the concept of diving also legally extends to immersion in other liquids, and exposure to other pressurised environments. [1] Some of the more common diving environments are listed and defined here.\nIce diving\nThe diving environment is limited by accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving is done in the shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect equipment configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. [2] Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. [3] Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team. [4]\nBenign conditions, sometimes also referred to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas. [5]\nOpen water is unrestricted water such as a sea, lake or flooded quarry , where the diver has unobstructed direct vertical access to the surface of the water in contact with the atmosphere. [6]\nOpen-water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air. [7]\nWall diving is done along a near vertical face. Blue-water diving is done in mid-water where the bottom is out of sight of the diver and there may be no fixed visual reference. [8]\nBlack-water diving is mid-water diving at night, particularly on a moonless night. [9] [10]\nAn overhead or penetration diving environment is where the diver enters a space from which there is no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving , wreck diving , ice diving and diving inside or under other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit. [11] [4] [3]\nNight diving can allow the diver to experience a different underwater environment , because many marine animals are nocturnal . [12]\nAltitude diving , for example in mountain lakes, requires modifications to the decompression schedule because of the reduced atmospheric pressure.

As a general rule, professional diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which are known for their convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions.\nRecreational dive sites  – Places that divers go to enjoy the underwater environment\nIndex of recreational dive sites  – Alphabetical listing of articles on porular places for recreational diving\nInland dive sites – Dive sites in bodies of water other than the sea\nCoastal dive sites – Dive sites near a coast of the body of water\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCoral reef  – Outcrop of rock in the sea formed by the growth and deposit of stony coral skeletons\nLake  – Large body of relatively still water\nMuck diving  – Recreational diving on a loose sedimentary bottom\nQuarry dive sites  – Disused and flooded quarry repurposed for underwater diving\nRocky reef  – Natural reef of rock\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nDiver training sites\nedit\nSee also: Diver training § Training venues for diving skills\nDiver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the environmental risk is relatively low. [15]\nSwimming pool  – Artificial water basin for swimming\nDiver training tank  – Tank of water to practice diving skills\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nHyperbaric treatment and transport environments\nedit\nPhysiologically and legally a compression in a diving chamber is considered a dive. Various options for hypebaric transport and treatment exist, each with its own characteristics, applications and operational procedures.\nClosed bell  – Hyperbaric chamber for transporting divers vertically through the water\nHyperbaric stretcher  – Portable pressure vessel to transport a person under pressure.\nHyperbaric lifeboat  – Lifeboat for transporting people under pressure\nIn-water recompression  – In-water treatment for decompression sickness\nRecompression chamber  – A hyperbaric chamber used to treat divers suffering from decompression illness\nEnvironments by confinement\nedit\nConfinement can influence diver safety and the ability of the diver to perform the required task. Some types of confinement improve safety by limiting the ability of the diver to move into higher risk areas, others limit the ability of the diver to maneuver or to escape to a place of safety in an emergency.\nConfined space  – Space with limited entry and egress and not suitable for human inhabitants\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training. The Queensland government define confined water for recreational diving purposes as \"Water which offers pool-like conditions, good visibility, and water which is shallow enough so that all divers can stand up with their heads well clear of the water\". [16] Other definitions do not require such shallow depth, but may have a depth restriction.\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nPenetration diving , also known as overhead environments – Diving under a physical barrier to a direct vertical ascent to the surface\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCavern diving  – Diving in the part of a cave where the exit is visible by natural light\nCulvert  – Structure to channel water past an obstacle\nIce diving  – Underwater diving under ice\nIntake  – Opening or structure through which a fluid is admitted into a space or machine\nPenstock  – Intake structure that controls water flow to turbines or sewerage systems\nOverhang  – Rocky part protruding from a cliff – A topographical feature which is open to one side, but obstructed overhead, and deep enough for a diver to be under the overhang.\nRestriction  – Space through which it is possible to pass with some difficulty – Space through which it is possible for a diver to pass with some difficulty. Section of a cave which is difficult to pass through due to lack of space. A minor restriction is too small for two divers to swim through together, a major restriction requires the diver to remove equipment to fit through. [17]\nSewerage  – Infrastructure that conveys sewage or surface runoff using sewers\nSwim-through  – Short underwater tunnel with adequate clearance and obvious exit – Arch, or short, clear tunnel that has sufficient space to allow a diver to swim through and where the light of the opening at the far end is visible through the hole.\nUnder ships – usually for inspection, maintenance and repair, or incidentally, when diving from one. In some cases the gap between the ship and the bottom or the jetty or dock can be quite small.\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nEnvironments by visibility\nedit\nVisibility in the diving medium directly affects diver safety and the ability to complete useful tasks. In some cases this can be mitigated by technology to improve visibility, but often the task procedures must be modified to suit the capacity of the diver, and the diver must have training and equipment bto deal with emergencies under more difficult circumstances.\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nLow visibility diving\nSilt out  – Reduction of underwater visibility by disturbing silt deposits\nNight diving  – Underwater diving during the hours of darkness\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nEnvironments by hazard\nedit\nBesides the hazards associated with the underwater environment itself, there are a considerable variety of hazard types and risk levels to which a diver may be exposed due to the circumstances of the dive task. Many of these are normally only encountered by professional specialists , and the means of reducing risk to an acceptable level may be complex and expensive.\nBenign water  – Diving environment with very low risk\nBomb disposal  – Activity to dispose of and render safe explosive munitions and other materials\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nCombat diving  – Tactical military scuba diving\nCurrents – Water flow in a locally consistent direction\nDelta P environments  – Hazards associated with underwater diving – Environments where a pressure difference causes flow. Usually refers to cases where the flow is likely to entrain and pull the diver into an enclosed space or moving machinery.\nIntakes from the body of water  – Opening or structure through which a fluid is admitted into a space or machine\nOutlets\nDrains\nPenstock  – Intake structure that controls water flow to turbines or sewerage systems\nSluice gate  – A movable gate allowing water to flow under it when opened\nHazmat diving  – Underwater diving in a known hazardous materials environment\nContaminated water  – Water containing high levels of hazardous materials\nNuclear diving  – Diving in an environment where there is a risk of exposure to radioactive materials\nSewer diving  – Diving for maintenance work in sewers\nLifting bag  – Airtight bag used for underwater buoyant lifting when filled with air\nLive-boat diving , also known as liveboat diving or live-boating – Diving from a boat which is under way (not moored) – Diving from a vessel which may have propellers or thrusters in gear during the dive.\nPenetration diving , also known as Overhead diving – Diving under a physical barrier to a direct vertical ascent to the surface\nUnderwater construction  – Industrial construction in an underwater environment\nUnderwater demolition  – The deliberate destruction or neutralization of man-made or natural underwater obstacles\nEnvironments by temperature\nedit\nThe temperature of the diving environment can influence the equipment used by the diver, and the time the diver can be exposed to the environment without excessive risk.\nDiving in hot water – Water that is hot enough to require measures to keep the diver cool.\nDiving in warm water – Water at temperatures where no thermal protection is necessary.\nDiving in cold water – Water where heat loss is a critical hazard. Arbitrarily specified at below 10 °C for some training standards\nDiving in freezing water – Water where surface layers are at or very near freezing point.\nEnvironments by geography\nedit\nThe geographical location of a dive site can have legal or environmental consequences.\nTropical diving – Diving in tropical waters\nTemperate water diving – Diving in temperate waters\nPolar diving - Diving in polar waters\nAltitude diving  – Underwater diving at altitudes above 300 m\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nDrift diving  – Scuba diving where the diver is intentionally transported by the water flow\nInland diving  – Diving in waters inland of the coastal high water mark.\nReef diving\nArtificial reef  – Human-made underwater structure that functions as a reef\nCoral reef  – Outcrop of rock in the sea formed by the growth and deposit of stony coral skeletons\nRocky reef  – Natural reef of rock\nInshore diving  – Diving in coastal territorial waters\nOffshore diving  – Diving outside the territorial waters of a country\nOpen ocean diving  – Diving in deep water out of sight of land\nEnvironments by topography\nedit\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nCave  – Natural underground space large enough for a human to enter\nCulvert  – Structure to channel water past an obstacle\nDam  – Barrier that stops or restricts the flow of surface or underground streams\nDeep diving  – Underwater diving to a depth beyond the norm accepted by the associated community\nFlooded mine  – Excavation for mineral extraction filled by water\nFlooded quarries  – Disused and flooded quarry repurposed for underwater diving\nIce diving  – Underwater diving under ice\nLake  – Large body of relatively still water\nMid-water  – At a depth away from surface and bottom – Away from any fixed solid reference points.\nMuck diving  – Recreational diving on a loose sedimentary bottom\nReef  – A shoal of rock, coral or other sufficiently coherent material, lying beneath the surface of water\nArtificial reef  – Human-made underwater structure that functions as a reef\nCoral reef  – Outcrop of rock in the sea formed by the growth and deposit of stony coral skeletons\nRocky reef  – Natural reef of rock\nRiver  – Natural flowing watercourse\nReservoir  – Storage space for water\nSump  – Low part of a volume that collects liquid by gravity\nSump (cave)  – Passage in a cave that is submerged under water\nTunnel  – Underground passage made for traffic\nWall diving  – Underwater diving alongside a near vertical face\nWater tank  – Container for storing water\nEnvironments by depth zone\nedit\nSee also: Deep diving\n \nA technical diver using a closed circuit rebreather with open circuit bailout cylinders returns from a 600-foot (180 m) dive.\nThe recreational diving depth limit set by the EN 14153-2 / ISO 24801-2 level 2 \" Autonomous Diver \" standard is 20 metres (66 ft). [18] The recommended depth limit for more extensively trained recreational divers ranges from 30 metres (98 ft) for PADI divers, [19] (this is the depth at which nitrogen narcosis symptoms generally begin to be noticeable in adults), to 40 metres (130 ft) specified by Recreational Scuba Training Council , [19] 50 metres (160 ft) for divers of the British Sub-Aqua Club and Sub-Aqua Association breathing air, [20] and 60 metres (200 ft) for teams of 2 to 3 French Level 3 recreational divers, breathing air. [21]\nFor technical divers, the recommended maximum depths are greater on the understanding that they will use less narcotic gas mixtures. 100 metres (330 ft) is the maximum depth authorised for divers who have completed Trimix Diver certification with IANTD [22] or Advanced Trimix Diver certification with TDI . [23] 332 metres (1,089 ft) is the world record depth on scuba (2014). [24] Commercial divers using saturation techniques and heliox breathing gases routinely exceed 100 metres (330 ft), but they are also limited by physiological constraints. Comex Hydra 8 experimental dives reached a record open water depth of 534 metres (1,752 ft) in 1988. [25] Atmospheric pressure diving suits are mainly constrained by the technology of the articulation seals, and a US Navy diver has dived to 610 metres (2,000 ft) in one. [26] [27]\nFrom an oceanographic viewpoint:\nShallow water, defined as between the surf-zone and the coast\nIntermediate water, defined as between the surf zone and wave base (where the waves just interact with the bottom and no more, usually about 80 m water depth with 10 second swells). The seafloor beneath intermediate water is termed the shoreface and is the zone where the seafloor slows down the swells by friction, so that the surf ends up being lower than it otherwise would be.\nDeep water, defined as deeper than wave base: i.e. too deep for waves to interact with the seafloor.\nRecreational divers will usually dive in the shallow to intermediate marine environment. Technical and commercial divers may venture into the deep water environment.\nEnvironments by professional activity\nedit\nSee also: Professional diving\nAquaculture  – Farming of aquatic organisms\nAquarium  – Transparent tank of water for fish and water-dwelling species\nArchaeological sites  – Place in which evidence of past activity is preserved\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nDeep sea mining , also known as Underwater mining – Mineral extraction from the ocean floor\nDemolition  – Tearing-down of buildings and other structures\nDry dock  – Basin drained to allow work on a vessel\nFish farms  – Raising fish commercially in enclosures\nForensic investigation  – Application of scientific investigation to criminal and civil laws\nInspection  – Organized examination or formal evaluation exercise\nMarine salvage  – Recovering a ship or cargo after a maritime casualty\nMilitary  – Organization primarily tasked with preparing for and conducting war\nMooring  – Structure for securing floating vessels\nSingle buoy mooring , also known as Single point mooring – Offshore mooring buoy with connections for loading or unloading tankers\nNuclear power plant  – Thermal power station where the heat source is a nuclear reactor\nOil rig  – Apparatus constructed for oil drilling\nOil platform , also known as Production platform – Offshore ocean structure with oil drilling and related facilities\nPublic safety diving  – Underwater work done by law enforcement, rescue and search and recovery teams\nScience  – Systematic endeavor for gaining knowledge\nSearch and rescue  – Search for and provision of aid to people who are in distress or imminent danger\nSewage treatment  – Process of removing contaminants from municipal wastewater\nShips husbandry  – Maintenance and upkeep of ships\nSubmarine pipeline  – Pipeline that is laid on the seabed or below it inside a trench\nSurveying  – Science of determining the positions of points and the distances and angles between them\nTraining  – Acquisition of knowledge, skills, and competencies as a result of teaching or practice\nUnderwater construction , also known as Civil engineering – Industrial construction in an underwater environment\nWellhead  – Component at the surface of a well that provides the structural and pressure-containing interface\nDiving medium\nedit\nUnderwater environment  – Aquatic or submarine environment\nFresh water  – Naturally occurring water with low amounts of dissolved salts\nPotable water  – Water safe for consumption\nBrackish water  – Water with salinity between freshwater and seawater\nSeawater  – Water from a sea or an ocean\nBrine  – Concentrated solution of salt in water\nContaminated water  – Water containing high levels of hazardous materials\nSewage  – Wastewater that is produced by a community of people\nDrilling fluid , also known as drilling mud – Aid for drilling boreholes into the ground\nPetroleum , also known as crude oil – Naturally occurring flammable liquid\nFuel oil  – Petroleum product burned to generate motive power or heat\nReferences\nedit\n^\nDiving Regulations 2009 .

There are different reasons to do this:\nRecreational diving is done for fun. It is sometimes called sport diving. It can be done using air from cylinders carried by the diver. This is called scuba diving . It can also be done for shorter dives by holding your breath. This is called freediving or skindiving.\nMilitary diving is diving for a military purpose.\nCommercial diving is diving to do underwater work. This is done as part of a project where the work must be done under water.\nScientific diving is diving done to find things out for scientific purposes. It may be part of the job for a scientist, or done by volunteer for a citizen science project.\nPublic safety diving is diving done by a public service organisation like the police of a fire department to rescue people or to find and bring back bodies or evidence.\nThere are also different ways to dive:\nSurface supplied diving gets air for breathing through a hose from a pump above the surface of the water.\nScuba diving is done with metal cylinders carried by the diver to hold the breathing air. In open-circuit scuba the air comes out of the mouthpiece when the diver breathes in, and goes into the water when the diver breathes out. When a rebreather is used, some of the same air is breathed many times, and the machine puts oxygen into the air to make up for the oxygen that is used up, and takes out the carbon dioxide by using a chemical to absorb it. A rebreather lets the diver use less air, but it can go wrong in more different ways.\nSaturation diving is diving where the divers stay in pressurised rooms between dives and go to the underwater workplace and return in a sealed diving bell , so they stay at the same pressure for days or weeks at a time before the pressure is reduced to normal air pressure when they finish the contract. The breathing gas is supplied from the surface through a hose so this is also a kind of surface supplied diving.\nFreediving is diving underwater without an air supply. The diver must hold their breath until they get back to the surface.\nImages for kids\nSurface-supplied divers riding a stage to the underwater workplace\nViews through a flat mask, above and below water\nRecreational breath-hold divers in basic equipment with floats and catch bags suitable for collecting lobster or shellfish\nJohn Scott Haldane, 1902\nIce diving\nThe Blue Hole in Dahab, Egypt, a world-renowned recreational dive site\nCommercial diver training in a quarry\nMilitary and commercial divers are trained in the procedures for use of a recompression chamber to treat diving disorders.\nSolo diver managing risk of breathing gas supply failure by carrying a bailout cylinder (slung at the diver's left side)\nA diver at work on hull maintenance\nSee also\nIn Spanish: Buceo para niños\nAll content from Kiddle encyclopedia articles (including the article images and facts) can be freely used under Attribution-ShareAlike license, unless stated otherwise.

This is a collaboration of Wikipedians dedicated to improving Wikipedia's coverage of underwater diving in all modes and the organization of information and articles on this topic. This page and its subpages contain their suggestions and various resources; it is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of other Wikipedians interested in the topic. If you would like to help, you are welcome to join the project, or just work on any related articles. The talk page is a place to discuss the project, and to notify page watchers of anything which may affect the project and its work. The to-do list below lists some of the work still to be done.\nThe project was originally called WikiProject Scuba diving , but the scope has expanded to be inclusive of all modes of underwater diving, so we changed the name to be more welcoming to other modes of diver.\nWikiProject Underwater diving does not have many active members, and this page is not updated very often, but there are a few members plugging away at improving and creating articles, so if you are interested, go ahead and do it. Join the project if you like. If you want assistance, or have some useful comments or requests, particularly about errors or content which you think we should add, leave a message on the project talk page .\nFor travel guides to recreational dive sites of the world, try the Wikivoyage articles on scuba diving\nGoals [ edit ]\nImprove Wikipedia's coverage on Underwater diving articles, including Scuba diving , surface-supplied diving , freediving , snorkelling and related topics:\nGet all project articles with Top or High importance rating up to Good Article class.\nCover the entire scope of the project with useful articles.\nProvide navigational aids so that readers can find the article they need.\nMaintain the Outline of underwater diving and Index of underwater diving and any subsets of these that may be appropriate\nManintain and extend Portal:Underwater diving and it's subportals to provide the best reasonably practicable introduction and guide to Wikipedia coverage of Underwater diving.\nProvide short descriptions for all underwater diving articles\nShort descriptions progress [ edit ]\nOut of Expression error: Unrecognized punctuation character \",\". eligible articles in the 3,040 Category:WikiProject SCUBA articles , (2215 have a short description.

Diving by non-human organisms is not, except peripherally where the physiology is of interest. Nor is the sport of jumping off high places into the water ( Diving (sport) ). The project name was originally WikiProject Scuba diving, but was changed to be more representative of the scope as defined.\nDiving equipment , diving support equipment , and equipment designed, manufactured or marketed specifically for use by divers is in scope, other equipment commonly used by divers may be in scope.\nDeep-submergence rescue vehicles , research submersibles and bathyspheres are included. Surface vessels which support this equipment, and military submarines (warships), are currently not included.\nBiographies of people who are notable for actual diving activities (including notable diving incidents), or who have contributed notably to the science or technology of diving usually also fall within scope. People who are notable for reasons not connected with diving, and are incidentally divers, are usually out of scope. Underwater scientific and archaeological sites repeatedly visited by divers may be in scope, generally when this is mentioned in the article.\nPlaces which are used as recreational dive sites are in scope when this is mentioned in the article and is verifiable.\nOrganisations which manufacture diving equipment, perform underwater work as a major part of their activity, train, certify, and register divers, publish standards for diving equipment, operations or training, may be in scope.\nPublications about diving, diver training, diving safety and diving research may be in scope.\nFinding content [ edit ]\nThere are several ways to find content on Wikipedia.\nIf you have a useful search string, a Google Search is quite effective.\nWikipedia search will take you directly to the article if you know the exact name or if Wikipedia has a redirect to the article. It will also suggest other articles in Wikipedia which may be relevant to your search criteria.\nThe navigation box at the bottom of pages which are relevant to the project provides links to the articles listed. (Not currently available on mobile).\nIf you want a list of articles in the project that you can browse through, looking for inspiration or a recognisable article title, then there are several other routes:\nOutline of underwater diving is a hierarchical list of all the articles, but may not always be up to date.\nIndex of underwater diving is an alphabetical list of the articles, (also not always up to date). It has sub-indexes for some of the associated groups of articles, such as:\nIndex of recreational dive sites\nIndex of underwater divers\nThe Glossary of underwater diving terminology is an alphabetical list of terms commonly used in diving and their meanings in this context. A useful quick reference. A definition will often contain a link to a detailed main article, or a section of an article on the term. If you can't find a term and are reasonably sure it is a diving term in general use in English, leave a note on the talk page.\nCategory:Underwater diving and the associated subcategories should also list all the articles, probably in a different hierarchical structure to that used for the navbox and outline list. Sometimes the category system can be more appropriate for finding information. It is also helpful for maintenance of Wikipedia and keeping track of the connectedness of articles.\nIf you have unlimited time and no special target, you can go down the rabbit-hole – Read the topic root article Underwater diving , and click on any link that looks interesting. Read until you find another interesting link and click on that, otherwise click your browser arrow to go back, and carry on. Stop when reality intrudes or you get bored, tired, thirsty or a fire breaks out.\nNone of these systems is perfect or complete. If you find an error or omission let us know, or fix it if you know how. This is a crowdsourced project – you can be one of the crowd.\nGuidelines [ edit ]\nStick with the Wikipedia:Manual of Style unless there is a good reason to do otherwise.\nWhen to create an article [ edit ]\nMost obvious subtopics of underwater diving already have an article, or are included as a section within an existing article. Do not create a new article for an alternative title to an existing article. Create a redirect if it does not already exist. If you think that the title should be changed, start a discussion on the talk page.\nAs a general principle, create an article when sure that the topic is notable and there will be enough content available from reliable published sources to produce a quality article within a reasonable timespan. If there is only a small amount of well referenced content, or there is not enough evidence of notability, it is usually better to use a section of an existing article. Create redirects to the section for potential titles.\nIf a section of an article ever gets too big it can be split off into a separate article. This can happen several times as more detail is added.\nComponents [ edit ]\nA component should usually be described in a section of the article on the whole apparatus. It gets its own article when the content is sufficiently complete and detailed to comply with the splitting criteria. For example, a Diving regulator is a part of a Scuba set , but contains sufficient content for a separate article, and there is adequate evidence of notability in the literature. Scuba set contains a summary section on diving regulators, as does any other article where it may be appropriate. These summary sections are tailored to suit the containing article, and would be different for Scuba set , Diving helmet and Rebreather .\nMechanism of diving regulators was split from Diving regulator as it is well supported by reliable sources establishing general notability, and there is adequate material to justify separate articles. Further splits are possible.\nOn the other hand, purge button and mouthpiece (scuba) are adequately covered as sections in Diving regulator , and were merged there from stubs. The redirects allow quick access to the sections covering those subtopics.\nNotability [ edit ]\nWe do not need an article on every term associated with underwater diving, even if it is notable. In some cases it is better to add a section to an existing article, and a term to the Glossary of underwater diving terminology . If you think that a topic has the potential to require a full article, then by all means create it. if it does not work out it can be merged later and redirected. It is often useful to create a redirect to a section of an article that covers a topic that does not have its own article.\n{{ Diving term }} will create a link to a term listed in the glossary of underwater diving terminology, but will not create a redlink if the term is not in the glossary. Use the term to be linked as the parameter – {{diving term|term to be linked}}\nWhen to create a redirect [ edit ]\nAny time a commonly used diving term is redlinked from an article, except for plural forms and misspellings (accepted and regional alternative spellings and terms that would be used by a literate person are legitimately eligible as redirects from synonyms).\nRedirect to the most comprehensive article or section on the topic that you can find – there may be several possibilities, but usually one of them is clearly the best.\nConsider adding a WP:short description to the redirect, and tag it with any appropriate tags, such as {{ R to section }}, {{ R from subtopic }}, {{ R with possibilities }}, or {{ R to synonym }}. Also check whether {{ R avoided double redirect }} would be appropriate if you can.\nConsider checking whether the term is listed in Glossary of underwater diving terminology . It may be worth adding it there too. If you can't work out the Wikicode used on that page, leave a message on the talk page with whatever information you would have used to add the term to the glossary, or failing that, at least the actual term. Sometimes we find that even obvious stuff has been missed.\nRating of redirects [ edit ]\nA redirect with possibilities can be rated for importance to the project. Mostly this will be \"Low\", generally meaning there is no rush as the existing article or section will do adequately until enough content accumulates to justify a split. Occasionally a \"Mid\" or even a \"High\" importance redirect topic may still be found. In these cases an article should be created if sufficient suitable sources are available to establish general notability and verifiability. You can just do it if you feel so inclined, but rating as Mid or High importance makes it likely that someone, sometime, will be reminded of the need, and may get round to it. Redirects which are inherently unsuitable for expansion into an article are rated N/A for importance.\nCategories for redirects [ edit ]\nCategories for redirects, particularly redirects from subtopics, are usually useful. Categories for redirects from synonyms are often just clutter on the category page. Use your discretion.\nProject overlap [ edit ]\nCollaborate with other projects wherever there is an overlap of interest. Some of our articles are within the scope of Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine , and where this is the case the manual of style for medical articles may be relevant. Articles about people must comply with the requirements of Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography .\nOther projects with significant overlap include:\nWikipedia:WikiProject Occupational Safety and Health\nWikipedia:WikiProject Physiology\nWikipedia:WikiProject Engineering\nWikipedia:WikiProject Technology\nTerminology and spelling [ edit ]\nCapitalise scuba in sentence case as a common noun or adjective depending on usage (see the Manual of Style mention). When part of a proper name it may be capitalised to suit accepted usage, and it should probably be capitalised as an initialism when referring to the specific oxygen rebreather designed by Christian Lambertsen . SSDE is capitalised as an initialism, as are SCBA, BCD, BC, CCR, SCR. When in doubt, use the full name in sentence case, many abbreviations are context sensitive, and we are not short of paper. Snuba also takes sentence case unless part of a proper name.\nPreferred spelling: freediving , breath-hold , sidemount (for the harness configuration).\nNot cast in stone: (if you have a strong opinion supported by evidence, please explain or link)\na free-flow (helmet type) or a regulator free-flow (malfunction), but a free flow as in unobstructed flow\nfull-face (mask type)\nlightweight (helmet type)\nsurface-supplied diving or surface supplied diving, both seem to be used, but we seem to use surface-supplied more often.\nair-line diving, using an air line or air hose for gas supply\nProject tagging [ edit ]\nWe have one project tag template, {{ WikiProject Scuba diving }} with shortcut {{ WPSCUBA }} . This template has parameters |class= and |importance= . Class refers to article quality and follows standard Wikipedia guidelines for article quality. Importance refers to importance of the article to encyclopedic coverage of underwater diving on Wikipedia . The same article may be of very different importance to other projects. Class and importance are independent variables, and have no influence on each other. B-Class or higher should be used only where there is evidence that the article has been assessed for that class.\nImportance [ edit ]\nTop importance refers to core articles that are obviously of critical importance for understanding the topic. Biographical articles are not top importance, nor are dive sites or organisations.\nHigh importance refers to topics that should be familiar to a trained and well informed diver. The topics should be of practical interest to a significant demographic of divers. Biographical articles, dive sites, and organisations are very unlikely to be high importance. When proposing a topic for high importance, please explain why the topic should be considered highly important in the context of diving .\nMid importance articles should be of some practical value or interest to most divers. Biographies of the most historically important divers, inventors, and researchers into diving physiology may be mid importance. People whose work changed diving significantly. These should be discussed on the project talk page. When in doubt, tag as low importance, and leave a note on the project talk page.\nLow importance covers the rest of main space articles. Only in exceptional cases will dive sites and biographies not be low importance.\nDisambiguation pages are usually NA importance, as are redirects to synonyms, though a Wikipedia:Redirect with possibilities will often be a low importance topic. Possibly even a medium or high importance topic that has been waiting for good sources to be found. Use discretion and discuss these cases.\nAt this stage of the encyclopedia, most topics of medium to top importance already exist. New articles are likely to be low importance, but this is not always the case. We may have overlooked something important. If you notice, let us know on the project talk page . New high importance articles are most likely to appear as splits from large existing top or high importance articles.\nInfoboxes [ edit ]\nWikiproject Underwater diving accepts infoboxes if they provide useful information and generally improve the usefulness of the article to the user. If the article is only tagged by Wikiproject Scuba diving on the talk page, there will probably not be any objection to adding a useful infobox. If there are other project banners, there may or may not be general acceptance of an infobox. If you add one and it is deleted, discuss before replacing.\nWe have one standard project infobox for equipment:\n{{ Infobox diving equipment }}\nOrganisations may use:\n{{ Infobox organization }}\nBiographies may use:\n{{ Infobox person }}\nMedical conditions and related may use one of the WikiProject Medicine infoboxes\nNavboxes [ edit ]\nWikiproject Underwater diving currently has two navboxes with collapsible sections,\n{{ Underwater diving }}, provides links to the articles considered reasonably relevant to the project other than recreational dive sites and regions. Reasonably relevant generally means that it is within the scope of the project. If in doubt, discuss on the project talk page. Editing the navbox to add or remove links requires template editor or administrator permissions, so if you cannot make an edit you consider useful, leave a message on the project talk page or the template talk page. The template has an unnamed parameter to display the relevant section for the article. Only one section will open, if the article is linked from more than one subgroup, choose the most relevant. The abbreviations used can be viewed in the template code, and are listed here for easy reference, but may be out of date. The parameter follows a pipe in the template, eg. {{Underwater diving|divequ}}.\nNavbov collapsible group title\nAbbreviation\nDiving equipment\ndivequ\nDiving support equipment\ndivsup\nFreediving\nfrediv\nProfessional diving\nprodiv\nRecreational diving\nrecdiv\nDiving safety\ndivsaf\nDiving medicine\ndivmed\nLaw\ndivlaw\nHistory of underwater diving\nhisdiv\nPublications\ndivpub\nTraining and registration\ntrareg\nUnderwater sports\nundspo\nUnderwater divers\nunddiv\nScience of underwater diving\nscidiv\nOther\nother\n{{ Recreational dive sites }} covers dive regions and sites. It should contain a link to any Wikipedia article in which there is clear mention that it represents a region known for multiple recreational dive sites, or that the subject is known as a recreational dive site. Some regions may be known for more than one type of dive site, and some dive sites may be of more than one type. Use discretion, it is not necessary to list every site under every applicable group. If in doubt, ask. This navbox also has a parameter to open the most relevant group when first expanded.\nNavbov collapsible group title\nAbbreviation\nReef diving regions\nreereg\nReef dive sites\nreesit\nWreck diving regions\nwrereg\nWreck dive sites\nwresit\nCave diving\ncavsit\nFreshwater diving sites\nfresit\nTraining sites\ntrasit\nRelated topics\nreltop\nInclusion of articles [ edit ]\nWikiproject scuba banners may be added to any talk page if the subject fits our scope. If in doubt, discuss. If you add a banner, make an estimate for class and importance. If you get it right, great. If not someone will fix it. If you change a class or importance rating that you did not originally set yourself, please leave an edit summary or talk page message explaining your motivation. Individual divers and dive sites are almost always low importance to the project.\nTo qualify for inclusion, an article on a dive site should include some referenced mention in the article text that it is known as a dive site, and an article on a diver should have some referenced mention of why they are notable as a diver. Owning a dive shop, working as an instructor, or publishing a blog are not sufficient, even if all three apply.\nReferencing [ edit ]\nIf there is no consensus objection from previous editors of an article, we suggest that:\nThe reference section should be titled \"References\",\nReferences that are cited multiple times by short form templates should be listed in a subsection titled \"Sources\", just below \"References\". Short form references that link to the source reference are preferred.\ngeneral footnotes should be in a section directly above \"References\" titled \"Notes\"\nthe reference definitions are listed in the reference section in columns about 30em wide. This is automatic by default\nthe reference definitions be alphabetically ordered by reference name. This makes them easier to re-use.\nreference names be chosen that are meaningful and easy to remember. <ref name=\"Author date\" />, <ref name=\"Editor date\" /> and <ref name=\"Publisher date\" /> are suggested as good practice. For multiple authors <ref name=\"Author1 and Author2 date\" />, or <ref name=\"Author et al date\" /> is fine. Feel free to rename meaningless automatically generated reference names to names based on one of the listed schemas, just make sure you get them all.\nthe CS1 templates be used for references, as they will give a reasonably consistent display, which is good when tidying up for GA or FA.\nMore information in a reference does no harm, even when not strictly necessary. Bare url's should be avoided as they may become broken, and lost forever, leaving their text unreferenced and vulnerable to deletion. This happens quite a lot. A bare url reference is better than nothing, if you are new and don't know how to create a proper reference, but try to do the job properly. An in-line external link is not a reference, and will be removed. If it does not have <ref></ref> or <ref name=\"\" /> it is not a reference .\nA statement is as good as its best reference: One good reference is worth more than any number of poor references, but poor references may be better than nothing.\nExceptional claims require strong evidence. If something is claimed to be a record or the best or worst a source must be cited. Historical claims and statistics are seldom obvious or common knowledge, cite your sources. If anyone can check the facts in real life, a reference is not essential, but it is good form to provide one anyway if you can.\nCommon knowledge is sometimes less common than one might assume. Common knowledge for a North Sea saturation diver may differ considerably from common knowledge for a Florida cave diver and both of these are likely to include a lot that is not common knowledge to a freshly cerificated recreational diver with 20 dives under their belt. Common knowledge may also be wrong, out of date, based on the untested opinions of a small group of people, based on the untested opinions of a large group of people, or warped by marketing forces.\nDefer to other Wikiproject styles when the article is rated as higher importance for that project than for WPSCUBA.\nPage numbers are good if available, chapters and sections also good. How they are best provided is not yet settled, but if they are known the format can be changed any time. If all else fails, leave as a comment after the reference name tag.\nOpen tasks [ edit ]\nTo-do list for Wikipedia:WikiProject Underwater diving :\nedit   ·   history   ·   watch   ·   refresh   ·  Updated 2024-03-13\nThere are no active tasks for this page\nRequests\nCreate articles for\nTechnical\nAquaCorps (Michael Menduno, ed.)\nBibliography of diving manuals for real manuals, not training manuals for a single recreational certificate\nBrush cart\nref1 , ref2\nCavitation cleaning\nref1 , ref2 , ref3 , reflist\nChamber of Diving and Watersports , the Egyptian government agency\nDive festival\nDive guide (publication)\nDiving contractor\nJump camera\nList of diving equipment manufacturers\nLong term health effects of diving\nBuzzacott, Peter (7 September 2018). \"Scuba Diving and Life Expectancy\" . www.dansa.org .

This is a collaboration of Wikipedians dedicated to improving Wikipedia's coverage of underwater diving in all modes and the organization of information and articles on this topic. This page and its subpages contain their suggestions and various resources; it is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of other Wikipedians interested in the topic. If you would like to help, you are welcome to join the project, or just work on any related articles. The talk page is a place to discuss the project, and to notify page watchers of anything which may affect the project and its work. The to-do list below lists some of the work still to be done.\nThe project was originally called WikiProject Scuba diving , but the scope has expanded to be inclusive of all modes of underwater diving, so we changed the name to be more welcoming to other modes of diver.\nWikiProject Underwater diving does not have many active members, and this page is not updated very often, but there are a few members plugging away at improving and creating articles, so if you are interested, go ahead and do it. Join the project if you like. If you want assistance, or have some useful comments or requests, particularly about errors or content which you think we should add, leave a message on the project talk page .\nFor travel guides to recreational dive sites of the world, try the Wikivoyage articles on scuba diving\nGoals [ edit ]\nImprove Wikipedia's coverage on Underwater diving articles, including Scuba diving , surface-supplied diving , freediving , snorkelling and related topics:\nGet all project articles with Top or High importance rating up to Good Article class.\nCover the entire scope of the project with useful articles.\nProvide navigational aids so that readers can find the article they need.\nMaintain the Outline of underwater diving and Index of underwater diving and any subsets of these that may be appropriate\nManintain and extend Portal:Underwater diving and it's subportals to provide the best reasonably practicable introduction and guide to Wikipedia coverage of Underwater diving.\nProvide short descriptions for all underwater diving articles\nShort descriptions progress [ edit ]\nOut of Expression error: Unrecognized punctuation character \",\". eligible articles in the 3,040 Category:WikiProject SCUBA articles , (2215 have a short description.

Diving by non-human organisms is not, except peripherally where the physiology is of interest. Nor is the sport of jumping off high places into the water ( Diving (sport) ). The project name was originally WikiProject Scuba diving, but was changed to be more representative of the scope as defined.\nDiving equipment , diving support equipment , and equipment designed, manufactured or marketed specifically for use by divers is in scope, other equipment commonly used by divers may be in scope.\nDeep-submergence rescue vehicles , research submersibles and bathyspheres are included. Surface vessels which support this equipment, and military submarines (warships), are currently not included.\nBiographies of people who are notable for actual diving activities (including notable diving incidents), or who have contributed notably to the science or technology of diving usually also fall within scope. People who are notable for reasons not connected with diving, and are incidentally divers, are usually out of scope. Underwater scientific and archaeological sites repeatedly visited by divers may be in scope, generally when this is mentioned in the article.\nPlaces which are used as recreational dive sites are in scope when this is mentioned in the article and is verifiable.\nOrganisations which manufacture diving equipment, perform underwater work as a major part of their activity, train, certify, and register divers, publish standards for diving equipment, operations or training, may be in scope.\nPublications about diving, diver training, diving safety and diving research may be in scope.\nFinding content [ edit ]\nThere are several ways to find content on Wikipedia.\nIf you have a useful search string, a Google Search is quite effective.\nWikipedia search will take you directly to the article if you know the exact name or if Wikipedia has a redirect to the article. It will also suggest other articles in Wikipedia which may be relevant to your search criteria.\nThe navigation box at the bottom of pages which are relevant to the project provides links to the articles listed. (Not currently available on mobile).\nIf you want a list of articles in the project that you can browse through, looking for inspiration or a recognisable article title, then there are several other routes:\nOutline of underwater diving is a hierarchical list of all the articles, but may not always be up to date.\nIndex of underwater diving is an alphabetical list of the articles, (also not always up to date). It has sub-indexes for some of the associated groups of articles, such as:\nIndex of recreational dive sites\nIndex of underwater divers\nThe Glossary of underwater diving terminology is an alphabetical list of terms commonly used in diving and their meanings in this context. A useful quick reference. A definition will often contain a link to a detailed main article, or a section of an article on the term. If you can't find a term and are reasonably sure it is a diving term in general use in English, leave a note on the talk page.\nCategory:Underwater diving and the associated subcategories should also list all the articles, probably in a different hierarchical structure to that used for the navbox and outline list. Sometimes the category system can be more appropriate for finding information. It is also helpful for maintenance of Wikipedia and keeping track of the connectedness of articles.\nIf you have unlimited time and no special target, you can go down the rabbit-hole – Read the topic root article Underwater diving , and click on any link that looks interesting. Read until you find another interesting link and click on that, otherwise click your browser arrow to go back, and carry on. Stop when reality intrudes or you get bored, tired, thirsty or a fire breaks out.\nNone of these systems is perfect or complete. If you find an error or omission let us know, or fix it if you know how. This is a crowdsourced project – you can be one of the crowd.\nGuidelines [ edit ]\nStick with the Wikipedia:Manual of Style unless there is a good reason to do otherwise.\nWhen to create an article [ edit ]\nMost obvious subtopics of underwater diving already have an article, or are included as a section within an existing article. Do not create a new article for an alternative title to an existing article. Create a redirect if it does not already exist. If you think that the title should be changed, start a discussion on the talk page.\nAs a general principle, create an article when sure that the topic is notable and there will be enough content available from reliable published sources to produce a quality article within a reasonable timespan. If there is only a small amount of well referenced content, or there is not enough evidence of notability, it is usually better to use a section of an existing article. Create redirects to the section for potential titles.\nIf a section of an article ever gets too big it can be split off into a separate article. This can happen several times as more detail is added.\nComponents [ edit ]\nA component should usually be described in a section of the article on the whole apparatus. It gets its own article when the content is sufficiently complete and detailed to comply with the splitting criteria. For example, a Diving regulator is a part of a Scuba set , but contains sufficient content for a separate article, and there is adequate evidence of notability in the literature. Scuba set contains a summary section on diving regulators, as does any other article where it may be appropriate. These summary sections are tailored to suit the containing article, and would be different for Scuba set , Diving helmet and Rebreather .\nMechanism of diving regulators was split from Diving regulator as it is well supported by reliable sources establishing general notability, and there is adequate material to justify separate articles. Further splits are possible.\nOn the other hand, purge button and mouthpiece (scuba) are adequately covered as sections in Diving regulator , and were merged there from stubs. The redirects allow quick access to the sections covering those subtopics.\nNotability [ edit ]\nWe do not need an article on every term associated with underwater diving, even if it is notable. In some cases it is better to add a section to an existing article, and a term to the Glossary of underwater diving terminology . If you think that a topic has the potential to require a full article, then by all means create it. if it does not work out it can be merged later and redirected. It is often useful to create a redirect to a section of an article that covers a topic that does not have its own article.\n{{ Diving term }} will create a link to a term listed in the glossary of underwater diving terminology, but will not create a redlink if the term is not in the glossary. Use the term to be linked as the parameter – {{diving term|term to be linked}}\nWhen to create a redirect [ edit ]\nAny time a commonly used diving term is redlinked from an article, except for plural forms and misspellings (accepted and regional alternative spellings and terms that would be used by a literate person are legitimately eligible as redirects from synonyms).\nRedirect to the most comprehensive article or section on the topic that you can find – there may be several possibilities, but usually one of them is clearly the best.\nConsider adding a WP:short description to the redirect, and tag it with any appropriate tags, such as {{ R to section }}, {{ R from subtopic }}, {{ R with possibilities }}, or {{ R to synonym }}. Also check whether {{ R avoided double redirect }} would be appropriate if you can.\nConsider checking whether the term is listed in Glossary of underwater diving terminology . It may be worth adding it there too. If you can't work out the Wikicode used on that page, leave a message on the talk page with whatever information you would have used to add the term to the glossary, or failing that, at least the actual term. Sometimes we find that even obvious stuff has been missed.\nRating of redirects [ edit ]\nA redirect with possibilities can be rated for importance to the project. Mostly this will be \"Low\", generally meaning there is no rush as the existing article or section will do adequately until enough content accumulates to justify a split. Occasionally a \"Mid\" or even a \"High\" importance redirect topic may still be found. In these cases an article should be created if sufficient suitable sources are available to establish general notability and verifiability. You can just do it if you feel so inclined, but rating as Mid or High importance makes it likely that someone, sometime, will be reminded of the need, and may get round to it. Redirects which are inherently unsuitable for expansion into an article are rated N/A for importance.\nCategories for redirects [ edit ]\nCategories for redirects, particularly redirects from subtopics, are usually useful. Categories for redirects from synonyms are often just clutter on the category page. Use your discretion.\nProject overlap [ edit ]\nCollaborate with other projects wherever there is an overlap of interest. Some of our articles are within the scope of Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine , and where this is the case the manual of style for medical articles may be relevant. Articles about people must comply with the requirements of Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography .\nOther projects with significant overlap include:\nWikipedia:WikiProject Occupational Safety and Health\nWikipedia:WikiProject Physiology\nWikipedia:WikiProject Engineering\nWikipedia:WikiProject Technology\nTerminology and spelling [ edit ]\nCapitalise scuba in sentence case as a common noun or adjective depending on usage (see the Manual of Style mention). When part of a proper name it may be capitalised to suit accepted usage, and it should probably be capitalised as an initialism when referring to the specific oxygen rebreather designed by Christian Lambertsen . SSDE is capitalised as an initialism, as are SCBA, BCD, BC, CCR, SCR. When in doubt, use the full name in sentence case, many abbreviations are context sensitive, and we are not short of paper. Snuba also takes sentence case unless part of a proper name.\nPreferred spelling: freediving , breath-hold , sidemount (for the harness configuration).\nNot cast in stone: (if you have a strong opinion supported by evidence, please explain or link)\na free-flow (helmet type) or a regulator free-flow (malfunction), but a free flow as in unobstructed flow\nfull-face (mask type)\nlightweight (helmet type)\nsurface-supplied diving or surface supplied diving, both seem to be used, but we seem to use surface-supplied more often.\nair-line diving, using an air line or air hose for gas supply\nProject tagging [ edit ]\nWe have one project tag template, {{ WikiProject Scuba diving }} with shortcut {{ WPSCUBA }} . This template has parameters |class= and |importance= . Class refers to article quality and follows standard Wikipedia guidelines for article quality. Importance refers to importance of the article to encyclopedic coverage of underwater diving on Wikipedia . The same article may be of very different importance to other projects. Class and importance are independent variables, and have no influence on each other. B-Class or higher should be used only where there is evidence that the article has been assessed for that class.\nImportance [ edit ]\nTop importance refers to core articles that are obviously of critical importance for understanding the topic. Biographical articles are not top importance, nor are dive sites or organisations.\nHigh importance refers to topics that should be familiar to a trained and well informed diver. The topics should be of practical interest to a significant demographic of divers. Biographical articles, dive sites, and organisations are very unlikely to be high importance. When proposing a topic for high importance, please explain why the topic should be considered highly important in the context of diving .\nMid importance articles should be of some practical value or interest to most divers. Biographies of the most historically important divers, inventors, and researchers into diving physiology may be mid importance. People whose work changed diving significantly. These should be discussed on the project talk page. When in doubt, tag as low importance, and leave a note on the project talk page.\nLow importance covers the rest of main space articles. Only in exceptional cases will dive sites and biographies not be low importance.\nDisambiguation pages are usually NA importance, as are redirects to synonyms, though a Wikipedia:Redirect with possibilities will often be a low importance topic. Possibly even a medium or high importance topic that has been waiting for good sources to be found. Use discretion and discuss these cases.\nAt this stage of the encyclopedia, most topics of medium to top importance already exist. New articles are likely to be low importance, but this is not always the case. We may have overlooked something important. If you notice, let us know on the project talk page . New high importance articles are most likely to appear as splits from large existing top or high importance articles.\nInfoboxes [ edit ]\nWikiproject Underwater diving accepts infoboxes if they provide useful information and generally improve the usefulness of the article to the user. If the article is only tagged by Wikiproject Scuba diving on the talk page, there will probably not be any objection to adding a useful infobox. If there are other project banners, there may or may not be general acceptance of an infobox. If you add one and it is deleted, discuss before replacing.\nWe have one standard project infobox for equipment:\n{{ Infobox diving equipment }}\nOrganisations may use:\n{{ Infobox organization }}\nBiographies may use:\n{{ Infobox person }}\nMedical conditions and related may use one of the WikiProject Medicine infoboxes\nNavboxes [ edit ]\nWikiproject Underwater diving currently has two navboxes with collapsible sections,\n{{ Underwater diving }}, provides links to the articles considered reasonably relevant to the project other than recreational dive sites and regions. Reasonably relevant generally means that it is within the scope of the project. If in doubt, discuss on the project talk page. Editing the navbox to add or remove links requires template editor or administrator permissions, so if you cannot make an edit you consider useful, leave a message on the project talk page or the template talk page. The template has an unnamed parameter to display the relevant section for the article. Only one section will open, if the article is linked from more than one subgroup, choose the most relevant. The abbreviations used can be viewed in the template code, and are listed here for easy reference, but may be out of date. The parameter follows a pipe in the template, eg. {{Underwater diving|divequ}}.\nNavbov collapsible group title\nAbbreviation\nDiving equipment\ndivequ\nDiving support equipment\ndivsup\nFreediving\nfrediv\nProfessional diving\nprodiv\nRecreational diving\nrecdiv\nDiving safety\ndivsaf\nDiving medicine\ndivmed\nLaw\ndivlaw\nHistory of underwater diving\nhisdiv\nPublications\ndivpub\nTraining and registration\ntrareg\nUnderwater sports\nundspo\nUnderwater divers\nunddiv\nScience of underwater diving\nscidiv\nOther\nother\n{{ Recreational dive sites }} covers dive regions and sites. It should contain a link to any Wikipedia article in which there is clear mention that it represents a region known for multiple recreational dive sites, or that the subject is known as a recreational dive site. Some regions may be known for more than one type of dive site, and some dive sites may be of more than one type. Use discretion, it is not necessary to list every site under every applicable group. If in doubt, ask. This navbox also has a parameter to open the most relevant group when first expanded.\nNavbov collapsible group title\nAbbreviation\nReef diving regions\nreereg\nReef dive sites\nreesit\nWreck diving regions\nwrereg\nWreck dive sites\nwresit\nCave diving\ncavsit\nFreshwater diving sites\nfresit\nTraining sites\ntrasit\nRelated topics\nreltop\nInclusion of articles [ edit ]\nWikiproject scuba banners may be added to any talk page if the subject fits our scope. If in doubt, discuss. If you add a banner, make an estimate for class and importance. If you get it right, great. If not someone will fix it. If you change a class or importance rating that you did not originally set yourself, please leave an edit summary or talk page message explaining your motivation. Individual divers and dive sites are almost always low importance to the project.\nTo qualify for inclusion, an article on a dive site should include some referenced mention in the article text that it is known as a dive site, and an article on a diver should have some referenced mention of why they are notable as a diver. Owning a dive shop, working as an instructor, or publishing a blog are not sufficient, even if all three apply.\nReferencing [ edit ]\nIf there is no consensus objection from previous editors of an article, we suggest that:\nThe reference section should be titled \"References\",\nReferences that are cited multiple times by short form templates should be listed in a subsection titled \"Sources\", just below \"References\". Short form references that link to the source reference are preferred.\ngeneral footnotes should be in a section directly above \"References\" titled \"Notes\"\nthe reference definitions are listed in the reference section in columns about 30em wide. This is automatic by default\nthe reference definitions be alphabetically ordered by reference name. This makes them easier to re-use.\nreference names be chosen that are meaningful and easy to remember. <ref name=\"Author date\" />, <ref name=\"Editor date\" /> and <ref name=\"Publisher date\" /> are suggested as good practice. For multiple authors <ref name=\"Author1 and Author2 date\" />, or <ref name=\"Author et al date\" /> is fine. Feel free to rename meaningless automatically generated reference names to names based on one of the listed schemas, just make sure you get them all.\nthe CS1 templates be used for references, as they will give a reasonably consistent display, which is good when tidying up for GA or FA.\nMore information in a reference does no harm, even when not strictly necessary. Bare url's should be avoided as they may become broken, and lost forever, leaving their text unreferenced and vulnerable to deletion. This happens quite a lot. A bare url reference is better than nothing, if you are new and don't know how to create a proper reference, but try to do the job properly. An in-line external link is not a reference, and will be removed. If it does not have <ref></ref> or <ref name=\"\" /> it is not a reference .\nA statement is as good as its best reference: One good reference is worth more than any number of poor references, but poor references may be better than nothing.\nExceptional claims require strong evidence. If something is claimed to be a record or the best or worst a source must be cited. Historical claims and statistics are seldom obvious or common knowledge, cite your sources. If anyone can check the facts in real life, a reference is not essential, but it is good form to provide one anyway if you can.\nCommon knowledge is sometimes less common than one might assume. Common knowledge for a North Sea saturation diver may differ considerably from common knowledge for a Florida cave diver and both of these are likely to include a lot that is not common knowledge to a freshly cerificated recreational diver with 20 dives under their belt. Common knowledge may also be wrong, out of date, based on the untested opinions of a small group of people, based on the untested opinions of a large group of people, or warped by marketing forces.\nDefer to other Wikiproject styles when the article is rated as higher importance for that project than for WPSCUBA.\nPage numbers are good if available, chapters and sections also good. How they are best provided is not yet settled, but if they are known the format can be changed any time. If all else fails, leave as a comment after the reference name tag.\nOpen tasks [ edit ]\nTo-do list for Wikipedia:WikiProject Underwater diving :\nedit   ·   history   ·   watch   ·   refresh   ·  Updated 2024-03-13\nThere are no active tasks for this page\nRequests\nCreate articles for\nTechnical\nAquaCorps (Michael Menduno, ed.)\nBibliography of diving manuals for real manuals, not training manuals for a single recreational certificate\nBrush cart\nref1 , ref2\nCavitation cleaning\nref1 , ref2 , ref3 , reflist\nChamber of Diving and Watersports , the Egyptian government agency\nDive festival\nDive guide (publication)\nDiving contractor\nJump camera\nList of diving equipment manufacturers\nLong term health effects of diving\nBuzzacott, Peter (7 September 2018). \"Scuba Diving and Life Expectancy\" . www.dansa.org .

Yes Popular pages Wikipedia:WikiProject Underwater diving/Popular pages\nWelcome to WikiProject Underwater diving . This is a collaboration of Wikipedians dedicated to improving Wikipedia's coverage of underwater diving in all modes and the organization of information and articles on this topic. This page and its subpages contain their suggestions and various resources; it is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of other Wikipedians interested in the topic. If you would like to help, you are welcome to join the project, or just work on any related articles. The talk page is a place to discuss the project, and to notify page watchers of anything which may affect the project and its work. The to-do list below lists some of the work still to be done.\nThe project was originally called WikiProject Scuba diving , but the scope has expanded to be inclusive of all modes of underwater diving, so we changed the name to be more welcoming to other modes of diver.\nWikiProject Underwater diving does not have many active members, and this page is not updated very often, but there are a few members plugging away at improving and creating articles, so if you are interested, go ahead and do it. Join the project if you like. If you want assistance, or have some useful comments or requests, particularly about errors or content which you think we should add, leave a message on the project talk page .\nFor travel guides to recreational dive sites of the world, try the Wikivoyage articles on scuba diving\nContents\n1\nGoals\n1.1\nShort descriptions progress\n2\nScope\n3\nFinding content\n4\nGuidelines\n4.1\nWhen to create an article\n4.1.1\nComponents\n4.1.2\nNotability\n4.2\nWhen to create a redirect\n4.2.1\nRating of redirects\n4.2.2\nCategories for redirects\n4.3\nProject overlap\n4.4\nTerminology and spelling\n4.5\nProject tagging\n4.5.1\nImportance\n4.6\nInfoboxes\n4.7\nNavboxes\n4.8\nInclusion of articles\n4.9\nReferencing\n5\nOpen tasks\n5.1\nArticle alerts\n6\nParticipants\n6.1\nPast participants\n7\nArticle statistics\n7.1\nRecognised content\n7.2\nMost viewed articles last month\n8\nList\n8.1\nMost edited articles in the last week\n8.2\nAssessment\n8.2.1\nVersion 1.0 Editorial Team Assessment\n8.2.2\nRecently assessed articles\n8.2.3\nFeatured articles candidates\n8.2.4\nGood article candidates\n8.2.4.1\nTop importance articles that are not yet nominated for GA or FA\n8.2.4.2\nHigh importance articles that are not yet nominated for GA or FA\n8.2.5\nHigh importance article B-class reviews\n8.2.6\nMid-importance B-class reviews\n8.3\nNew articles\n8.4\nMerge proposals\n8.5\nSplit proposals\n8.6\nMove proposals\n8.7\nImages needed\n8.8\nClean up\n8.9\nTagged for expansion\n8.10\nNominated for deletion\n8.11\nExpand\n9\nShort descriptions\n10\nTemplates\n10.1\nProject-related\n10.2\nUserboxes\n10.2.1\nProject-related\n10.2.2\nInterest-related\n10.2.3\nAgency-related\n10.3\nBarnstar\n11\nCategories\n11.1\nRelated categories\n12\nResources\n12.1\nRelated projects\n13\nExternal links\nGoals\nedit\nImprove Wikipedia's coverage on Underwater diving articles, including Scuba diving , surface-supplied diving , freediving , snorkelling and related topics:\nGet all project articles with Top or High importance rating up to Good Article class.\nCover the entire scope of the project with useful articles.\nProvide navigational aids so that readers can find the article they need.\nMaintain the Outline of underwater diving and Index of underwater diving and any subsets of these that may be appropriate\nManintain and extend Portal:Underwater diving and it's subportals to provide the best reasonably practicable introduction and guide to Wikipedia coverage of Underwater diving.\nProvide short descriptions for all underwater diving articles\nShort descriptions progress\nedit\nOut of Expression error: Unrecognized punctuation character \",\". eligible articles in the 3,040 Category:WikiProject SCUBA articles , (2215 have a short description.

Diving by non-human organisms is not, except peripherally where the physiology is of interest. Nor is the sport of jumping off high places into the water ( Diving (sport) ). The project name was originally WikiProject Scuba diving, but was changed to be more representative of the scope as defined.\nDiving equipment , diving support equipment , and equipment designed, manufactured or marketed specifically for use by divers is in scope, other equipment commonly used by divers may be in scope.\nDeep-submergence rescue vehicles , research submersibles and bathyspheres are included. Surface vessels which support this equipment, and military submarines (warships), are currently not included.\nBiographies of people who are notable for actual diving activities (including notable diving incidents), or who have contributed notably to the science or technology of diving usually also fall within scope. People who are notable for reasons not connected with diving, and are incidentally divers, are usually out of scope. Underwater scientific and archaeological sites repeatedly visited by divers may be in scope, generally when this is mentioned in the article.\nPlaces which are used as recreational dive sites are in scope when this is mentioned in the article and is verifiable.\nOrganisations which manufacture diving equipment, perform underwater work as a major part of their activity, train, certify, and register divers, publish standards for diving equipment, operations or training, may be in scope.\nPublications about diving, diver training, diving safety and diving research may be in scope.\nFinding content\nedit\nThere are several ways to find content on Wikipedia.\nIf you have a useful search string, a Google Search is quite effective.\nWikipedia search will take you directly to the article if you know the exact name or if Wikipedia has a redirect to the article. It will also suggest other articles in Wikipedia which may be relevant to your search criteria.\nThe navigation box at the bottom of pages which are relevant to the project provides links to the articles listed. (Not currently available on mobile).\nIf you want a list of articles in the project that you can browse through, looking for inspiration or a recognisable article title, then there are several other routes:\nOutline of underwater diving is a hierarchical list of all the articles, but may not always be up to date.\nIndex of underwater diving is an alphabetical list of the articles, (also not always up to date). It has sub-indexes for some of the associated groups of articles, such as:\nIndex of recreational dive sites\nIndex of underwater divers\nThe Glossary of underwater diving terminology is an alphabetical list of terms commonly used in diving and their meanings in this context. A useful quick reference. A definition will often contain a link to a detailed main article, or a section of an article on the term. If you can't find a term and are reasonably sure it is a diving term in general use in English, leave a note on the talk page.\nCategory:Underwater diving and the associated subcategories should also list all the articles, probably in a different hierarchical structure to that used for the navbox and outline list. Sometimes the category system can be more appropriate for finding information. It is also helpful for maintenance of Wikipedia and keeping track of the connectedness of articles.\nIf you have unlimited time and no special target, you can go down the rabbit-hole – Read the topic root article Underwater diving , and click on any link that looks interesting. Read until you find another interesting link and click on that, otherwise click your browser arrow to go back, and carry on. Stop when reality intrudes or you get bored, tired, thirsty or a fire breaks out.\nNone of these systems is perfect or complete. If you find an error or omission let us know, or fix it if you know how. This is a crowdsourced project – you can be one of the crowd.\nGuidelines\nedit\nStick with the Wikipedia:Manual of Style unless there is a good reason to do otherwise.\nWhen to create an article\nedit\nMost obvious subtopics of underwater diving already have an article, or are included as a section within an existing article. Do not create a new article for an alternative title to an existing article. Create a redirect if it does not already exist. If you think that the title should be changed, start a discussion on the talk page.\nAs a general principle, create an article when sure that the topic is notable and there will be enough content available from reliable published sources to produce a quality article within a reasonable timespan. If there is only a small amount of well referenced content, or there is not enough evidence of notability, it is usually better to use a section of an existing article. Create redirects to the section for potential titles.\nIf a section of an article ever gets too big it can be split off into a separate article. This can happen several times as more detail is added.\nComponents\nedit\nA component should usually be described in a section of the article on the whole apparatus. It gets its own article when the content is sufficiently complete and detailed to comply with the splitting criteria. For example, a Diving regulator is a part of a Scuba set , but contains sufficient content for a separate article, and there is adequate evidence of notability in the literature. Scuba set contains a summary section on diving regulators, as does any other article where it may be appropriate. These summary sections are tailored to suit the containing article, and would be different for Scuba set , Diving helmet and Rebreather .\nMechanism of diving regulators was split from Diving regulator as it is well supported by reliable sources establishing general notability, and there is adequate material to justify separate articles. Further splits are possible.\nOn the other hand, purge button and mouthpiece (scuba) are adequately covered as sections in Diving regulator , and were merged there from stubs. The redirects allow quick access to the sections covering those subtopics.\nNotability\nedit\nWe do not need an article on every term associated with underwater diving, even if it is notable. In some cases it is better to add a section to an existing article, and a term to the Glossary of underwater diving terminology . If you think that a topic has the potential to require a full article, then by all means create it. if it does not work out it can be merged later and redirected. It is often useful to create a redirect to a section of an article that covers a topic that does not have its own article.\n{{ Diving term }} will create a link to a term listed in the glossary of underwater diving terminology, but will not create a redlink if the term is not in the glossary. Use the term to be linked as the parameter – {{diving term|term to be linked}}\nWhen to create a redirect\nedit\nAny time a commonly used diving term is redlinked from an article, except for plural forms and misspellings (accepted and regional alternative spellings and terms that would be used by a literate person are legitimately eligible as redirects from synonyms).\nRedirect to the most comprehensive article or section on the topic that you can find – there may be several possibilities, but usually one of them is clearly the best.\nConsider adding a WP:short description to the redirect, and tag it with any appropriate tags, such as {{ R to section }}, {{ R from subtopic }}, {{ R with possibilities }}, or {{ R to synonym }}. Also check whether {{ R avoided double redirect }} would be appropriate if you can.\nConsider checking whether the term is listed in Glossary of underwater diving terminology . It may be worth adding it there too. If you can't work out the Wikicode used on that page, leave a message on the talk page with whatever information you would have used to add the term to the glossary, or failing that, at least the actual term. Sometimes we find that even obvious stuff has been missed.\nRating of redirects\nedit\nA redirect with possibilities can be rated for importance to the project. Mostly this will be \"Low\", generally meaning there is no rush as the existing article or section will do adequately until enough content accumulates to justify a split. Occasionally a \"Mid\" or even a \"High\" importance redirect topic may still be found. In these cases an article should be created if sufficient suitable sources are available to establish general notability and verifiability. You can just do it if you feel so inclined, but rating as Mid or High importance makes it likely that someone, sometime, will be reminded of the need, and may get round to it. Redirects which are inherently unsuitable for expansion into an article are rated N/A for importance.\nCategories for redirects\nedit\nCategories for redirects, particularly redirects from subtopics, are usually useful. Categories for redirects from synonyms are often just clutter on the category page. Use your discretion.\nProject overlap\nedit\nCollaborate with other projects wherever there is an overlap of interest. Some of our articles are within the scope of Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine , and where this is the case the manual of style for medical articles may be relevant. Articles about people must comply with the requirements of Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography .\nOther projects with significant overlap include:\nWikipedia:WikiProject Occupational Safety and Health\nWikipedia:WikiProject Physiology\nWikipedia:WikiProject Engineering\nWikipedia:WikiProject Technology\nTerminology and spelling\nedit\nCapitalise scuba in sentence case as a common noun or adjective depending on usage (see the Manual of Style mention). When part of a proper name it may be capitalised to suit accepted usage, and it should probably be capitalised as an initialism when referring to the specific oxygen rebreather designed by Christian Lambertsen . SSDE is capitalised as an initialism, as are SCBA, BCD, BC, CCR, SCR. When in doubt, use the full name in sentence case, many abbreviations are context sensitive, and we are not short of paper. Snuba also takes sentence case unless part of a proper name.\nPreferred spelling: freediving , breath-hold , sidemount (for the harness configuration).\nNot cast in stone: (if you have a strong opinion supported by evidence, please explain or link)\na free-flow (helmet type) or a regulator free-flow (malfunction), but a free flow as in unobstructed flow\nfull-face (mask type)\nlightweight (helmet type)\nsurface-supplied diving or surface supplied diving, both seem to be used, but we seem to use surface-supplied more often.\nair-line diving, using an air line or air hose for gas supply\nProject tagging\nedit\nWe have one project tag template, {{ WikiProject Scuba diving }} with shortcut {{ WPSCUBA }} . This template has parameters |class= and |importance= . Class refers to article quality and follows standard Wikipedia guidelines for article quality. Importance refers to importance of the article to encyclopedic coverage of underwater diving on Wikipedia . The same article may be of very different importance to other projects. Class and importance are independent variables, and have no influence on each other. B-Class or higher should be used only where there is evidence that the article has been assessed for that class.\nImportance\nedit\nTop importance refers to core articles that are obviously of critical importance for understanding the topic. Biographical articles are not top importance, nor are dive sites or organisations.\nHigh importance refers to topics that should be familiar to a trained and well informed diver. The topics should be of practical interest to a significant demographic of divers. Biographical articles, dive sites, and organisations are very unlikely to be high importance. When proposing a topic for high importance, please explain why the topic should be considered highly important in the context of diving .\nMid importance articles should be of some practical value or interest to most divers. Biographies of the most historically important divers, inventors, and researchers into diving physiology may be mid importance. People whose work changed diving significantly. These should be discussed on the project talk page. When in doubt, tag as low importance, and leave a note on the project talk page.\nLow importance covers the rest of main space articles. Only in exceptional cases will dive sites and biographies not be low importance.\nDisambiguation pages are usually NA importance, as are redirects to synonyms, though a Wikipedia:Redirect with possibilities will often be a low importance topic. Possibly even a medium or high importance topic that has been waiting for good sources to be found. Use discretion and discuss these cases.\nAt this stage of the encyclopedia, most topics of medium to top importance already exist. New articles are likely to be low importance, but this is not always the case. We may have overlooked something important. If you notice, let us know on the project talk page . New high importance articles are most likely to appear as splits from large existing top or high importance articles.\nInfoboxes\nedit\nWikiproject Underwater diving accepts infoboxes if they provide useful information and generally improve the usefulness of the article to the user. If the article is only tagged by Wikiproject Scuba diving on the talk page, there will probably not be any objection to adding a useful infobox. If there are other project banners, there may or may not be general acceptance of an infobox. If you add one and it is deleted, discuss before replacing.\nWe have one standard project infobox for equipment:\n{{ Infobox diving equipment }}\nOrganisations may use:\n{{ Infobox organization }}\nBiographies may use:\n{{ Infobox person }}\nMedical conditions and related may use one of the WikiProject Medicine infoboxes\nNavboxes\nedit\nWikiproject Underwater diving currently has two navboxes with collapsible sections,\n{{ Underwater diving }}, provides links to the articles considered reasonably relevant to the project other than recreational dive sites and regions. Reasonably relevant generally means that it is within the scope of the project. If in doubt, discuss on the project talk page. Editing the navbox to add or remove links requires template editor or administrator permissions, so if you cannot make an edit you consider useful, leave a message on the project talk page or the template talk page. The template has an unnamed parameter to display the relevant section for the article. Only one section will open, if the article is linked from more than one subgroup, choose the most relevant. The abbreviations used can be viewed in the template code, and are listed here for easy reference, but may be out of date. The parameter follows a pipe in the template, eg. {{Underwater diving|divequ}}.\nNavbov collapsible group title\nAbbreviation\nDiving equipment\ndivequ\nDiving support equipment\ndivsup\nFreediving\nfrediv\nProfessional diving\nprodiv\nRecreational diving\nrecdiv\nDiving safety\ndivsaf\nDiving medicine\ndivmed\nLaw\ndivlaw\nHistory of underwater diving\nhisdiv\nPublications\ndivpub\nTraining and registration\ntrareg\nUnderwater sports\nundspo\nUnderwater divers\nunddiv\nScience of underwater diving\nscidiv\nOther\nother\n{{ Recreational dive sites }} covers dive regions and sites. It should contain a link to any Wikipedia article in which there is clear mention that it represents a region known for multiple recreational dive sites, or that the subject is known as a recreational dive site. Some regions may be known for more than one type of dive site, and some dive sites may be of more than one type. Use discretion, it is not necessary to list every site under every applicable group. If in doubt, ask. This navbox also has a parameter to open the most relevant group when first expanded.\nNavbov collapsible group title\nAbbreviation\nReef diving regions\nreereg\nReef dive sites\nreesit\nWreck diving regions\nwrereg\nWreck dive sites\nwresit\nCave diving\ncavsit\nFreshwater diving sites\nfresit\nTraining sites\ntrasit\nRelated topics\nreltop\nInclusion of articles\nedit\nWikiproject scuba banners may be added to any talk page if the subject fits our scope. If in doubt, discuss. If you add a banner, make an estimate for class and importance. If you get it right, great. If not someone will fix it. If you change a class or importance rating that you did not originally set yourself, please leave an edit summary or talk page message explaining your motivation. Individual divers and dive sites are almost always low importance to the project.\nTo qualify for inclusion, an article on a dive site should include some referenced mention in the article text that it is known as a dive site, and an article on a diver should have some referenced mention of why they are notable as a diver. Owning a dive shop, working as an instructor, or publishing a blog are not sufficient, even if all three apply.\nReferencing\nedit\nIf there is no consensus objection from previous editors of an article, we suggest that:\nThe reference section should be titled \"References\",\nReferences that are cited multiple times by short form templates should be listed in a subsection titled \"Sources\", just below \"References\". Short form references that link to the source reference are preferred.\ngeneral footnotes should be in a section directly above \"References\" titled \"Notes\"\nthe reference definitions are listed in the reference section in columns about 30em wide. This is automatic by default\nthe reference definitions be alphabetically ordered by reference name. This makes them easier to re-use.\nreference names be chosen that are meaningful and easy to remember. <ref name=\"Author date\" />, <ref name=\"Editor date\" /> and <ref name=\"Publisher date\" /> are suggested as good practice. For multiple authors <ref name=\"Author1 and Author2 date\" />, or <ref name=\"Author et al date\" /> is fine. Feel free to rename meaningless automatically generated reference names to names based on one of the listed schemas, just make sure you get them all.\nthe CS1 templates be used for references, as they will give a reasonably consistent display, which is good when tidying up for GA or FA.\nMore information in a reference does no harm, even when not strictly necessary. Bare url's should be avoided as they may become broken, and lost forever, leaving their text unreferenced and vulnerable to deletion. This happens quite a lot. A bare url reference is better than nothing, if you are new and don't know how to create a proper reference, but try to do the job properly. An in-line external link is not a reference, and will be removed. If it does not have <ref></ref> or <ref name=\"\" /> it is not a reference .\nA statement is as good as its best reference: One good reference is worth more than any number of poor references, but poor references may be better than nothing.\nExceptional claims require strong evidence. If something is claimed to be a record or the best or worst a source must be cited. Historical claims and statistics are seldom obvious or common knowledge, cite your sources. If anyone can check the facts in real life, a reference is not essential, but it is good form to provide one anyway if you can.\nCommon knowledge is sometimes less common than one might assume. Common knowledge for a North Sea saturation diver may differ considerably from common knowledge for a Florida cave diver and both of these are likely to include a lot that is not common knowledge to a freshly cerificated recreational diver with 20 dives under their belt. Common knowledge may also be wrong, out of date, based on the untested opinions of a small group of people, based on the untested opinions of a large group of people, or warped by marketing forces.\nDefer to other Wikiproject styles when the article is rated as higher importance for that project than for WPSCUBA.\nPage numbers are good if available, chapters and sections also good. How they are best provided is not yet settled, but if they are known the format can be changed any time. If all else fails, leave as a comment after the reference name tag.\nOpen tasks\nedit\n \nTo-do list for Wikipedia:WikiProject Underwater diving :\nedit   ·   history   ·   watch   ·   refresh   ·  Updated 2024-03-13\n \nThere are no active tasks for this page\nRequests\nCreate articles for\nTechnical\nAquaCorps (Michael Menduno, ed.)\nBibliography of diving manuals for real manuals, not training manuals for a single recreational certificate\nBrush cart\nref1 , ref2\nCavitation cleaning\nref1 , ref2 , ref3 , reflist\nChamber of Diving and Watersports , the Egyptian government agency\nDive festival\nDive guide (publication)\nDiving contractor\nJump camera\nList of diving equipment manufacturers\nLong term health effects of diving\nBuzzacott, Peter (7 September 2018). \"Scuba Diving and Life Expectancy\" . www.dansa.org .

This is a collaboration of Wikipedians dedicated to improving Wikipedia's coverage of underwater diving in all modes and the organization of information and articles on this topic. This page and its subpages contain their suggestions and various resources; it is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of other Wikipedians interested in the topic. If you would like to help, you are welcome to join the project, or just work on any related articles. The talk page is a place to discuss the project, and to notify page watchers of anything which may affect the project and its work. The to-do list below lists some of the work still to be done.\nThe project was originally called WikiProject Scuba diving , but the scope has expanded to be inclusive of all modes of underwater diving, so we changed the name to be more welcoming to other modes of diver.\nWikiProject Underwater diving does not have many active members, and this page is not updated very often, but there are a few members plugging away at improving and creating articles, so if you are interested, go ahead and do it. Join the project if you like. If you want assistance, or have some useful comments or requests, particularly about errors or content which you think we should add, leave a message on the project talk page .\nFor travel guides to recreational dive sites of the world, try the Wikivoyage articles on scuba diving\nContents\n1\nGoals\n1.1\nShort descriptions progress\n2\nScope\n3\nFinding content\n4\nGuidelines\n4.1\nWhen to create an article\n4.1.1\nComponents\n4.1.2\nNotability\n4.2\nWhen to create a redirect\n4.2.1\nRating of redirects\n4.2.2\nCategories for redirects\n4.3\nProject overlap\n4.4\nTerminology and spelling\n4.5\nProject tagging\n4.5.1\nImportance\n4.6\nInfoboxes\n4.7\nNavboxes\n4.8\nInclusion of articles\n4.9\nReferencing\n5\nOpen tasks\n5.1\nArticle alerts\n6\nParticipants\n6.1\nPast participants\n7\nArticle statistics\n7.1\nRecognised content\n7.2\nMost viewed articles last month\n8\nList\n8.1\nMost edited articles in the last week\n8.2\nAssessment\n8.2.1\nVersion 1.0 Editorial Team Assessment\n8.2.2\nRecently assessed articles\n8.2.3\nFeatured articles candidates\n8.2.4\nGood article candidates\n8.2.4.1\nTop importance articles that are not yet nominated for GA or FA\n8.2.4.2\nHigh importance articles that are not yet nominated for GA or FA\n8.2.5\nHigh importance article B-class reviews\n8.2.6\nMid-importance B-class reviews\n8.3\nNew articles\n8.4\nMerge proposals\n8.5\nSplit proposals\n8.6\nMove proposals\n8.7\nImages needed\n8.8\nClean up\n8.9\nTagged for expansion\n8.10\nNominated for deletion\n8.11\nExpand\n9\nShort descriptions\n10\nTemplates\n10.1\nProject-related\n10.2\nUserboxes\n10.2.1\nProject-related\n10.2.2\nInterest-related\n10.2.3\nAgency-related\n10.3\nBarnstar\n11\nCategories\n11.1\nRelated categories\n12\nResources\n12.1\nRelated projects\n13\nExternal links\nGoals\nedit\nImprove Wikipedia's coverage on Underwater diving articles, including Scuba diving , surface-supplied diving , freediving , snorkelling and related topics:\nGet all project articles with Top or High importance rating up to Good Article class.\nCover the entire scope of the project with useful articles.\nProvide navigational aids so that readers can find the article they need.\nMaintain the Outline of underwater diving and Index of underwater diving and any subsets of these that may be appropriate\nManintain and extend Portal:Underwater diving and it's subportals to provide the best reasonably practicable introduction and guide to Wikipedia coverage of Underwater diving.\nProvide short descriptions for all underwater diving articles\nShort descriptions progress\nedit\nOut of Expression error: Unrecognized punctuation character \",\". eligible articles in the 3,041 Category:WikiProject SCUBA articles , (2215 have a short description.

Diving by non-human organisms is not, except peripherally where the physiology is of interest. Nor is the sport of jumping off high places into the water ( Diving (sport) ). The project name was originally WikiProject Scuba diving, but was changed to be more representative of the scope as defined.\nDiving equipment , diving support equipment , and equipment designed, manufactured or marketed specifically for use by divers is in scope, other equipment commonly used by divers may be in scope.\nDeep-submergence rescue vehicles , research submersibles and bathyspheres are included. Surface vessels which support this equipment, and military submarines (warships), are currently not included.\nBiographies of people who are notable for actual diving activities (including notable diving incidents), or who have contributed notably to the science or technology of diving usually also fall within scope. People who are notable for reasons not connected with diving, and are incidentally divers, are usually out of scope. Underwater scientific and archaeological sites repeatedly visited by divers may be in scope, generally when this is mentioned in the article.\nPlaces which are used as recreational dive sites are in scope when this is mentioned in the article and is verifiable.\nOrganisations which manufacture diving equipment, perform underwater work as a major part of their activity, train, certify, and register divers, publish standards for diving equipment, operations or training, may be in scope.\nPublications about diving, diver training, diving safety and diving research may be in scope.\nFinding content\nedit\nThere are several ways to find content on Wikipedia.\nIf you have a useful search string, a Google Search is quite effective.\nWikipedia search will take you directly to the article if you know the exact name or if Wikipedia has a redirect to the article. It will also suggest other articles in Wikipedia which may be relevant to your search criteria.\nThe navigation box at the bottom of pages which are relevant to the project provides links to the articles listed. (Not currently available on mobile).\nIf you want a list of articles in the project that you can browse through, looking for inspiration or a recognisable article title, then there are several other routes:\nOutline of underwater diving is a hierarchical list of all the articles, but may not always be up to date.\nIndex of underwater diving is an alphabetical list of the articles, (also not always up to date). It has sub-indexes for some of the associated groups of articles, such as:\nIndex of recreational dive sites\nIndex of underwater divers\nThe Glossary of underwater diving terminology is an alphabetical list of terms commonly used in diving and their meanings in this context. A useful quick reference. A definition will often contain a link to a detailed main article, or a section of an article on the term. If you can't find a term and are reasonably sure it is a diving term in general use in English, leave a note on the talk page.\nCategory:Underwater diving and the associated subcategories should also list all the articles, probably in a different hierarchical structure to that used for the navbox and outline list. Sometimes the category system can be more appropriate for finding information. It is also helpful for maintenance of Wikipedia and keeping track of the connectedness of articles.\nIf you have unlimited time and no special target, you can go down the rabbit-hole – Read the topic root article Underwater diving , and click on any link that looks interesting. Read until you find another interesting link and click on that, otherwise click your browser arrow to go back, and carry on. Stop when reality intrudes or you get bored, tired, thirsty or a fire breaks out.\nNone of these systems is perfect or complete. If you find an error or omission let us know, or fix it if you know how. This is a crowdsourced project – you can be one of the crowd.\nGuidelines\nedit\nStick with the Wikipedia:Manual of Style unless there is a good reason to do otherwise.\nWhen to create an article\nedit\nMost obvious subtopics of underwater diving already have an article, or are included as a section within an existing article. Do not create a new article for an alternative title to an existing article. Create a redirect if it does not already exist. If you think that the title should be changed, start a discussion on the talk page.\nAs a general principle, create an article when sure that the topic is notable and there will be enough content available from reliable published sources to produce a quality article within a reasonable timespan. If there is only a small amount of well referenced content, or there is not enough evidence of notability, it is usually better to use a section of an existing article. Create redirects to the section for potential titles.\nIf a section of an article ever gets too big it can be split off into a separate article. This can happen several times as more detail is added.\nComponents\nedit\nA component should usually be described in a section of the article on the whole apparatus. It gets its own article when the content is sufficiently complete and detailed to comply with the splitting criteria. For example, a Diving regulator is a part of a Scuba set , but contains sufficient content for a separate article, and there is adequate evidence of notability in the literature. Scuba set contains a summary section on diving regulators, as does any other article where it may be appropriate. These summary sections are tailored to suit the containing article, and would be different for Scuba set , Diving helmet and Rebreather .\nMechanism of diving regulators was split from Diving regulator as it is well supported by reliable sources establishing general notability, and there is adequate material to justify separate articles. Further splits are possible.\nOn the other hand, purge button and mouthpiece (scuba) are adequately covered as sections in Diving regulator , and were merged there from stubs. The redirects allow quick access to the sections covering those subtopics.\nNotability\nedit\nWe do not need an article on every term associated with underwater diving, even if it is notable. In some cases it is better to add a section to an existing article, and a term to the Glossary of underwater diving terminology . If you think that a topic has the potential to require a full article, then by all means create it. if it does not work out it can be merged later and redirected. It is often useful to create a redirect to a section of an article that covers a topic that does not have its own article.\n{{ Diving term }} will create a link to a term listed in the glossary of underwater diving terminology, but will not create a redlink if the term is not in the glossary. Use the term to be linked as the parameter – {{diving term|term to be linked}}\nWhen to create a redirect\nedit\nAny time a commonly used diving term is redlinked from an article, except for plural forms and misspellings (accepted and regional alternative spellings and terms that would be used by a literate person are legitimately eligible as redirects from synonyms).\nRedirect to the most comprehensive article or section on the topic that you can find – there may be several possibilities, but usually one of them is clearly the best.\nConsider adding a WP:short description to the redirect, and tag it with any appropriate tags, such as {{ R to section }}, {{ R from subtopic }}, {{ R with possibilities }}, or {{ R to synonym }}. Also check whether {{ R avoided double redirect }} would be appropriate if you can.\nConsider checking whether the term is listed in Glossary of underwater diving terminology . It may be worth adding it there too. If you can't work out the Wikicode used on that page, leave a message on the talk page with whatever information you would have used to add the term to the glossary, or failing that, at least the actual term. Sometimes we find that even obvious stuff has been missed.\nRating of redirects\nedit\nA redirect with possibilities can be rated for importance to the project. Mostly this will be \"Low\", generally meaning there is no rush as the existing article or section will do adequately until enough content accumulates to justify a split. Occasionally a \"Mid\" or even a \"High\" importance redirect topic may still be found. In these cases an article should be created if sufficient suitable sources are available to establish general notability and verifiability. You can just do it if you feel so inclined, but rating as Mid or High importance makes it likely that someone, sometime, will be reminded of the need, and may get round to it. Redirects which are inherently unsuitable for expansion into an article are rated N/A for importance.\nCategories for redirects\nedit\nCategories for redirects, particularly redirects from subtopics, are usually useful. Categories for redirects from synonyms are often just clutter on the category page. Use your discretion.\nProject overlap\nedit\nCollaborate with other projects wherever there is an overlap of interest. Some of our articles are within the scope of Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine , and where this is the case the manual of style for medical articles may be relevant. Articles about people must comply with the requirements of Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Biography .\nOther projects with significant overlap include:\nWikipedia:WikiProject Occupational Safety and Health\nWikipedia:WikiProject Physiology\nWikipedia:WikiProject Engineering\nWikipedia:WikiProject Technology\nTerminology and spelling\nedit\nCapitalise scuba in sentence case as a common noun or adjective depending on usage (see the Manual of Style mention). When part of a proper name it may be capitalised to suit accepted usage, and it should probably be capitalised as an initialism when referring to the specific oxygen rebreather designed by Christian Lambertsen . SSDE is capitalised as an initialism, as are SCBA, BCD, BC, CCR, SCR. When in doubt, use the full name in sentence case, many abbreviations are context sensitive, and we are not short of paper. Snuba also takes sentence case unless part of a proper name.\nPreferred spelling: freediving , breath-hold , sidemount (for the harness configuration).\nNot cast in stone: (if you have a strong opinion supported by evidence, please explain or link)\na free-flow (helmet type) or a regulator free-flow (malfunction), but a free flow as in unobstructed flow\nfull-face (mask type)\nlightweight (helmet type)\nsurface-supplied diving or surface supplied diving, both seem to be used, but we seem to use surface-supplied more often.\nair-line diving, using an air line or air hose for gas supply\nProject tagging\nedit\nWe have one project tag template, {{ WikiProject Scuba diving }} with shortcut {{ WPSCUBA }} . This template has parameters |class= and |importance= . Class refers to article quality and follows standard Wikipedia guidelines for article quality. Importance refers to importance of the article to encyclopedic coverage of underwater diving on Wikipedia . The same article may be of very different importance to other projects. Class and importance are independent variables, and have no influence on each other. B-Class or higher should be used only where there is evidence that the article has been assessed for that class.\nImportance\nedit\nTop importance refers to core articles that are obviously of critical importance for understanding the topic. Biographical articles are not top importance, nor are dive sites or organisations.\nHigh importance refers to topics that should be familiar to a trained and well informed diver. The topics should be of practical interest to a significant demographic of divers. Biographical articles, dive sites, and organisations are very unlikely to be high importance. When proposing a topic for high importance, please explain why the topic should be considered highly important in the context of diving .\nMid importance articles should be of some practical value or interest to most divers. Biographies of the most historically important divers, inventors, and researchers into diving physiology may be mid importance. People whose work changed diving significantly. These should be discussed on the project talk page. When in doubt, tag as low importance, and leave a note on the project talk page.\nLow importance covers the rest of main space articles. Only in exceptional cases will dive sites and biographies not be low importance.\nDisambiguation pages are usually NA importance, as are redirects to synonyms, though a Wikipedia:Redirect with possibilities will often be a low importance topic. Possibly even a medium or high importance topic that has been waiting for good sources to be found. Use discretion and discuss these cases.\nAt this stage of the encyclopedia, most topics of medium to top importance already exist. New articles are likely to be low importance, but this is not always the case. We may have overlooked something important. If you notice, let us know on the project talk page . New high importance articles are most likely to appear as splits from large existing top or high importance articles.\nInfoboxes\nedit\nWikiproject Underwater diving accepts infoboxes if they provide useful information and generally improve the usefulness of the article to the user. If the article is only tagged by Wikiproject Scuba diving on the talk page, there will probably not be any objection to adding a useful infobox. If there are other project banners, there may or may not be general acceptance of an infobox. If you add one and it is deleted, discuss before replacing.\nWe have one standard project infobox for equipment:\n{{ Infobox diving equipment }}\nOrganisations may use:\n{{ Infobox organization }}\nBiographies may use:\n{{ Infobox person }}\nMedical conditions and related may use one of the WikiProject Medicine infoboxes\nNavboxes\nedit\nWikiproject Underwater diving currently has two navboxes with collapsible sections,\n{{ Underwater diving }}, provides links to the articles considered reasonably relevant to the project other than recreational dive sites and regions. Reasonably relevant generally means that it is within the scope of the project. If in doubt, discuss on the project talk page. Editing the navbox to add or remove links requires template editor or administrator permissions, so if you cannot make an edit you consider useful, leave a message on the project talk page or the template talk page. The template has an unnamed parameter to display the relevant section for the article. Only one section will open, if the article is linked from more than one subgroup, choose the most relevant. The abbreviations used can be viewed in the template code, and are listed here for easy reference, but may be out of date. The parameter follows a pipe in the template, eg. {{Underwater diving|divequ}}.\nNavbov collapsible group title\nAbbreviation\nDiving equipment\ndivequ\nDiving support equipment\ndivsup\nFreediving\nfrediv\nProfessional diving\nprodiv\nRecreational diving\nrecdiv\nDiving safety\ndivsaf\nDiving medicine\ndivmed\nLaw\ndivlaw\nHistory of underwater diving\nhisdiv\nPublications\ndivpub\nTraining and registration\ntrareg\nUnderwater sports\nundspo\nUnderwater divers\nunddiv\nScience of underwater diving\nscidiv\nOther\nother\n{{ Recreational dive sites }} covers dive regions and sites. It should contain a link to any Wikipedia article in which there is clear mention that it represents a region known for multiple recreational dive sites, or that the subject is known as a recreational dive site. Some regions may be known for more than one type of dive site, and some dive sites may be of more than one type. Use discretion, it is not necessary to list every site under every applicable group. If in doubt, ask. This navbox also has a parameter to open the most relevant group when first expanded.\nNavbov collapsible group title\nAbbreviation\nReef diving regions\nreereg\nReef dive sites\nreesit\nWreck diving regions\nwrereg\nWreck dive sites\nwresit\nCave diving\ncavsit\nFreshwater diving sites\nfresit\nTraining sites\ntrasit\nRelated topics\nreltop\nInclusion of articles\nedit\nWikiproject scuba banners may be added to any talk page if the subject fits our scope. If in doubt, discuss. If you add a banner, make an estimate for class and importance. If you get it right, great. If not someone will fix it. If you change a class or importance rating that you did not originally set yourself, please leave an edit summary or talk page message explaining your motivation. Individual divers and dive sites are almost always low importance to the project.\nTo qualify for inclusion, an article on a dive site should include some referenced mention in the article text that it is known as a dive site, and an article on a diver should have some referenced mention of why they are notable as a diver. Owning a dive shop, working as an instructor, or publishing a blog are not sufficient, even if all three apply.\nReferencing\nedit\nIf there is no consensus objection from previous editors of an article, we suggest that:\nThe reference section should be titled \"References\",\nReferences that are cited multiple times by short form templates should be listed in a subsection titled \"Sources\", just below \"References\". Short form references that link to the source reference are preferred.\ngeneral footnotes should be in a section directly above \"References\" titled \"Notes\"\nthe reference definitions are listed in the reference section in columns about 30em wide. This is automatic by default\nthe reference definitions be alphabetically ordered by reference name. This makes them easier to re-use.\nreference names be chosen that are meaningful and easy to remember. <ref name=\"Author date\" />, <ref name=\"Editor date\" /> and <ref name=\"Publisher date\" /> are suggested as good practice. For multiple authors <ref name=\"Author1 and Author2 date\" />, or <ref name=\"Author et al date\" /> is fine. Feel free to rename meaningless automatically generated reference names to names based on one of the listed schemas, just make sure you get them all.\nthe CS1 templates be used for references, as they will give a reasonably consistent display, which is good when tidying up for GA or FA.\nMore information in a reference does no harm, even when not strictly necessary. Bare url's should be avoided as they may become broken, and lost forever, leaving their text unreferenced and vulnerable to deletion. This happens quite a lot. A bare url reference is better than nothing, if you are new and don't know how to create a proper reference, but try to do the job properly. An in-line external link is not a reference, and will be removed. If it does not have <ref></ref> or <ref name=\"\" /> it is not a reference .\nA statement is as good as its best reference: One good reference is worth more than any number of poor references, but poor references may be better than nothing.\nExceptional claims require strong evidence. If something is claimed to be a record or the best or worst a source must be cited. Historical claims and statistics are seldom obvious or common knowledge, cite your sources. If anyone can check the facts in real life, a reference is not essential, but it is good form to provide one anyway if you can.\nCommon knowledge is sometimes less common than one might assume. Common knowledge for a North Sea saturation diver may differ considerably from common knowledge for a Florida cave diver and both of these are likely to include a lot that is not common knowledge to a freshly cerificated recreational diver with 20 dives under their belt. Common knowledge may also be wrong, out of date, based on the untested opinions of a small group of people, based on the untested opinions of a large group of people, or warped by marketing forces.\nDefer to other Wikiproject styles when the article is rated as higher importance for that project than for WPSCUBA.\nPage numbers are good if available, chapters and sections also good. How they are best provided is not yet settled, but if they are known the format can be changed any time. If all else fails, leave as a comment after the reference name tag.\nOpen tasks\nedit\n \nTo-do list for Wikipedia:WikiProject Underwater diving :\nedit   ·   history   ·   watch   ·   refresh   ·  Updated 2024-03-13\n \nThere are no active tasks for this page\nRequests\nCreate articles for\nTechnical\nAquaCorps (Michael Menduno, ed.)\nBibliography of diving manuals for real manuals, not training manuals for a single recreational certificate\nBrush cart\nref1 , ref2\nCavitation cleaning\nref1 , ref2 , ref3 , reflist\nChamber of Diving and Watersports , the Egyptian government agency\nDive festival\nDive guide (publication)\nDiving contractor\nJump camera\nList of diving equipment manufacturers\nLong term health effects of diving\nBuzzacott, Peter (7 September 2018). \"Scuba Diving and Life Expectancy\" . www.dansa.org .

کپسول، شیر و رگلاتور است.\nرگلاتور غواصی یا تنظیم‌کنندهٔ فشار هوای تنفسی [ ویرایش ]\nرگلاتور غواصی اسکوبا\nرگلاتور وسیله‌ای‌ست که هوای تنفسیِ پرفشار درون سیلندر را برای تنفس غواص آماده می‌کند و او را قادر می‌سازد تا در زیر آب تنفس کند. این بخش از تجهیزات اجازه می‌دهد که هوا با فشار مناسب و به‌صورت یکسان به غواص رسانده شود. رگلاتورها دارای دو مرحله کاهش فشار هستند: در مرحلهٔ نخست، هوای پرفشار درون تانک به فشار متوسط کاهش می‌یابد؛ در مرحلهٔ دوم آن فشار متوسط به فشاری معادل با فشار محیط کاهش می‌یابد تا غواص بتواند به‌سادگی از آن تنفس کند. مرحلهٔ دوم رگلاتورها، که در دهان قرار می‌گیرد، دارای دکمه‌ای فشاری در جلو است که برای بیرون راندن آب از درون آن استفاده می‌شود.\nکپسول اسکوبا یا تانک هوا [ ویرایش ]\nسیلندر و کپسول اسکوبا\nتانک هوا یا کپسول اسکوبا، سیلندر فلزیِ خاصی‌ست که می‌توان هوای تنفسی را با فشار در آن ذخیره کرد. این وسیله از نوع مارین استیل (فولاد دریایی) یا آلومینیوم ساخته می‌شود و هوای درون آن به‌وسیلهٔ یک شیر به خارج راه می‌یابد.\nکپسول اسکوبا سیستم تنفس زیرآبی که محتوای هوای فشرده می‌باشد است و مخفف اصطلاح انگلیسیِ Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus است، حاوی هوای تنفسی‌ست که مهم‌ترین عنصر موردنیاز فعالیت‌های زیرآبی است و همان‌گونه که اشاره شد، این هوا مخلوطی از ۲۱٪ اکسیژن و ۷۹٪ نیتروژن است. بنابراین و بر خلاف عقیدهٔ بسیاری از مردم، که تصور می‌کنند غواصان به‌هنگام غواصی اکسیژن تنفس می‌نمایند، این هوا، هوای معمولیِ موجود در اتمسفر زمین است و اکسیژن نیست.\nاین هوا در غواصیِ تفریحی توسط کمپرسورهای مخصوص هوای تنفسی فشرده شده و پس از خشک شدن (رطوبت‌گیری) درون سیلندر یا تانک هوا ذخیره می‌گردد.\nمنابع [ ویرایش ]\nویکی‌پدیای انگلیسی\nراهنمای جامع غواصی

It is usually underwater , but professional diving is sometimes done in other liquids. Underwater diving is the human practice of voluntarily descending below the surface of the water to interact with the surroundings, for various recreational or occupational reasons, but the concept of diving also legally extends to immersion in other liquids, and exposure to other pressurised environments. [1] Some of the more common diving environments are listed and defined here.\nThe diving environment is limited by accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving is done in the shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect equipment configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. [2] Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. [3] Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team. [4]\nBenign conditions, sometimes also referred to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas. [5]\nOpen water is unrestricted water such as a sea, lake or flooded quarry , where the diver has unobstructed direct vertical access to the surface of the water in contact with the atmosphere. [6]\nOpen-water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air. [7]\nWall diving is done along a near vertical face. Blue-water diving is done in mid-water where the bottom is out of sight of the diver and there may be no fixed visual reference. [8]\nBlack-water diving is mid-water diving at night, particularly on a moonless night. [9] [10]\nAn overhead or penetration diving environment is where the diver enters a space from which there is no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving , wreck diving , ice diving and diving inside or under other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit. [11] [4] [3]\nNight diving can allow the diver to experience a different underwater environment , because many marine animals are nocturnal . [12]\nAltitude diving , for example in mountain lakes, requires modifications to the decompression schedule because of the reduced atmospheric pressure. [13] [14]\nRecreational dive sites [ edit ]\nThe Blue Hole in Dahab, Egypt , a world-renowned recreational dive site\nMain article: Recreational dive sites\nThe common term for a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As a general rule, professional diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which are known for their convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions.\nRecreational dive sites  – Places that divers go to enjoy the underwater environment\nIndex of recreational dive sites  – Alphabetical listing of articles on porular places for recreational diving\nInland dive sites – Dive sites in bodies of water other than the sea\nCoastal dive sites – Dive sites near a coast of the body of water\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCoral reef  – Outcrop of rock in the sea formed by the growth and deposit of stony coral skeletons\nLake  – Large body of relatively still water\nMuck diving  – Recreational diving on a loose sedimentary bottom\nQuarry dive sites  – Disused and flooded quarry repurposed for underwater diving\nRocky reef  – Natural reef of rock\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nDiver training sites [ edit ]\nSee also: Diver training § Training venues for diving skills\nDiver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the environmental risk is relatively low. [15]\nSwimming pool  – Artificial water basin for swimming\nDiver training tank  – Tank of water to practice diving skills\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nHyperbaric treatment and transport environments [ edit ]\nPhysiologically and legally a compression in a diving chamber is considered a dive. Various options for hypebaric transport and treatment exist, each with its own characteristics, applications and operational procedures.\nClosed bell  – Hyperbaric chamber for transporting divers vertically through the water\nHyperbaric stretcher  – Portable pressure vessel to transport a person under pressure.\nHyperbaric lifeboat  – Lifeboat for transporting people under pressure\nIn-water recompression  – In-water treatment for decompression sickness\nRecompression chamber  – A hyperbaric chamber used to treat divers suffering from decompression illness\nEnvironments by confinement [ edit ]\nConfinement can influence diver safety and the ability of the diver to perform the required task. Some types of confinement improve safety by limiting the ability of the diver to move into higher risk areas, others limit the ability of the diver to maneuver or to escape to a place of safety in an emergency.\nConfined space  – Space with limited entry and egress and not suitable for human inhabitants\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training. The Queensland government define confined water for recreational diving purposes as \"Water which offers pool-like conditions, good visibility, and water which is shallow enough so that all divers can stand up with their heads well clear of the water\". [16] Other definitions do not require such shallow depth, but may have a depth restriction.\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nPenetration diving , also known as overhead environments – Diving under a physical barrier to a direct vertical ascent to the surface\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCavern diving  – Diving in the part of a cave where the exit is visible by natural light\nCulvert  – Structure to channel water past an obstacle\nIce diving  – Underwater diving under ice\nIntake  – Opening or structure through which a fluid is admitted into a space or machine\nPenstock  – Intake structure that controls water flow to turbines or sewerage systems\nOverhang  – Rocky part protruding from a cliff – A topographical feature which is open to one side, but obstructed overhead, and deep enough for a diver to be under the overhang.\nRestriction  – Space through which it is possible to pass with some difficulty – Space through which it is possible for a diver to pass with some difficulty. Section of a cave which is difficult to pass through due to lack of space. A minor restriction is too small for two divers to swim through together, a major restriction requires the diver to remove equipment to fit through. [17]\nSewerage  – Infrastructure that conveys sewage or surface runoff using sewers\nSwim-through  – Short underwater tunnel with adequate clearance and obvious exit – Arch, or short, clear tunnel that has sufficient space to allow a diver to swim through and where the light of the opening at the far end is visible through the hole.\nUnder ships – usually for inspection, maintenance and repair, or incidentally, when diving from one. In some cases the gap between the ship and the bottom or the jetty or dock can be quite small.\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nEnvironments by visibility [ edit ]\nVisibility in the diving medium directly affects diver safety and the ability to complete useful tasks. In some cases this can be mitigated by technology to improve visibility, but often the task procedures must be modified to suit the capacity of the diver, and the diver must have training and equipment bto deal with emergencies under more difficult circumstances.\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nLow visibility diving\nSilt out  – Reduction of underwater visibility by disturbing silt deposits\nNight diving  – Underwater diving during the hours of darkness\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nEnvironments by hazard [ edit ]\nBesides the hazards associated with the underwater environment itself, there are a considerable variety of hazard types and risk levels to which a diver may be exposed due to the circumstances of the dive task. Many of these are normally only encountered by professional specialists , and the means of reducing risk to an acceptable level may be complex and expensive.\nBenign water  – Diving environment with very low risk\nBomb disposal  – Activity to dispose of and render safe explosive munitions and other materials\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nCombat diving  – Tactical military scuba diving\nCurrents – Water flow in a locally consistent direction\nDelta P environments  – Hazards associated with underwater diving – Environments where a pressure difference causes flow. Usually refers to cases where the flow is likely to entrain and pull the diver into an enclosed space or moving machinery.\nIntakes from the body of water  – Opening or structure through which a fluid is admitted into a space or machine\nOutlets\nDrains\nPenstock  – Intake structure that controls water flow to turbines or sewerage systems\nSluice gate  – A movable gate allowing water to flow under it when opened\nHazmat diving  – Underwater diving in a known hazardous materials environment\nContaminated water  – Water containing high levels of hazardous materials\nNuclear diving  – Diving in an environment where there is a risk of exposure to radioactive materials\nSewer diving  – Diving for maintenance work in sewers\nLifting bag  – Airtight bag used for underwater buoyant lifting when filled with air\nLive-boat diving , also known as liveboat diving or live-boating – Diving from a boat which is under way (not moored) – Diving from a vessel which may have propellers or thrusters in gear during the dive.\nPenetration diving , also known as Overhead diving – Diving under a physical barrier to a direct vertical ascent to the surface\nUnderwater construction  – Industrial construction in an underwater environment\nUnderwater demolition  – The deliberate destruction or neutralization of man-made or natural underwater obstacles\nEnvironments by temperature [ edit ]\nThe temperature of the diving environment can influence the equipment used by the diver, and the time the diver can be exposed to the environment without excessive risk.\nDiving in hot water – Water that is hot enough to require measures to keep the diver cool.\nDiving in warm water – Water at temperatures where no thermal protection is necessary.\nDiving in cold water – Water where heat loss is a critical hazard.

[18] The recommended depth limit for more extensively trained recreational divers ranges from 30 metres (98 ft) for PADI divers, [19] (this is the depth at which nitrogen narcosis symptoms generally begin to be noticeable in adults), to 40 metres (130 ft) specified by Recreational Scuba Training Council , [19] 50 metres (160 ft) for divers of the British Sub-Aqua Club and Sub-Aqua Association breathing air, [20] and 60 metres (200 ft) for teams of 2 to 3 French Level 3 recreational divers, breathing air. [21]\nFor technical divers, the recommended maximum depths are greater on the understanding that they will use less narcotic gas mixtures. 100 metres (330 ft) is the maximum depth authorised for divers who have completed Trimix Diver certification with IANTD [22] or Advanced Trimix Diver certification with TDI . [23] 332 metres (1,089 ft) is the world record depth on scuba (2014). [24] Commercial divers using saturation techniques and heliox breathing gases routinely exceed 100 metres (330 ft), but they are also limited by physiological constraints. Comex Hydra 8 experimental dives reached a record open water depth of 534 metres (1,752 ft) in 1988. [25] Atmospheric pressure diving suits are mainly constrained by the technology of the articulation seals, and a US Navy diver has dived to 610 metres (2,000 ft) in one. [26] [27]\nFrom an oceanographic viewpoint:\nShallow water, defined as between the surf-zone and the coast\nIntermediate water, defined as between the surf zone and wave base (where the waves just interact with the bottom and no more, usually about 80 m water depth with 10 second swells). The seafloor beneath intermediate water is termed the shoreface and is the zone where the seafloor slows down the swells by friction, so that the surf ends up being lower than it otherwise would be.\nDeep water, defined as deeper than wave base: i.e. too deep for waves to interact with the seafloor.\nRecreational divers will usually dive in the shallow to intermediate marine environment. Technical and commercial divers may venture into the deep water environment.\nEnvironments by professional activity [ edit ]\nSee also: Professional diving\nAquaculture  – Farming of aquatic organisms\nAquarium  – Transparent tank of water for fish and water-dwelling species\nArchaeological sites  – Place in which evidence of past activity is preserved\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nDeep sea mining , also known as Underwater mining – Mineral extraction from the ocean floor\nDemolition  – Tearing-down of buildings and other structures\nDry dock  – Basin drained to allow work on a vessel\nFish farms  – Raising fish commercially in enclosures\nForensic investigation  – Application of scientific investigation to criminal and civil laws\nInspection  – Organized examination or formal evaluation exercise\nMarine salvage  – Recovering a ship or cargo after a maritime casualty\nMilitary  – Organization primarily tasked with preparing for and conducting war\nMooring  – Structure for securing floating vessels\nSingle buoy mooring , also known as Single point mooring – Offshore mooring buoy with connections for loading or unloading tankers\nNuclear power plant  – Thermal power station where the heat source is a nuclear reactor\nOil rig  – Apparatus constructed for oil drilling\nOil platform , also known as Production platform – Offshore ocean structure with oil drilling and related facilities\nPublic safety diving  – Underwater work done by law enforcement, rescue and search and recovery teams\nScience  – Systematic endeavor for gaining knowledge\nSearch and rescue  – Search for and provision of aid to people who are in distress or imminent danger\nSewage treatment  – Process of removing contaminants from municipal wastewater\nShips husbandry  – Maintenance and upkeep of ships\nSubmarine pipeline  – Pipeline that is laid on the seabed or below it inside a trench\nSurveying  – Science of determining the positions of points and the distances and angles between them\nTraining  – Acquisition of knowledge, skills, and competencies as a result of teaching or practice\nUnderwater construction , also known as Civil engineering – Industrial construction in an underwater environment\nWellhead  – Component at the surface of a well that provides the structural and pressure-containing interface\nDiving medium [ edit ]\nUnderwater environment  – Aquatic or submarine environment\nFresh water  – Naturally occurring water with low amounts of dissolved salts\nPotable water  – Water safe for consumption\nBrackish water  – Water with salinity between freshwater and seawater\nSeawater  – Water from a sea or an ocean\nBrine  – Concentrated solution of salt in water\nContaminated water  – Water containing high levels of hazardous materials\nSewage  – Wastewater that is produced by a community of people\nDrilling fluid , also known as drilling mud – Aid for drilling boreholes into the ground\nPetroleum , also known as crude oil – Naturally occurring flammable liquid\nFuel oil  – Petroleum product burned to generate motive power or heat\nReferences [ edit ]\n^\nDiving Regulations 2009 .

It is usually underwater , but professional diving is sometimes done in other liquids. Underwater diving is the human practice of voluntarily descending below the surface of the water to interact with the surroundings, for various recreational or occupational reasons, but the concept of diving also legally extends to immersion in other liquids, and exposure to other pressurised environments. [1] Some of the more common diving environments are listed and defined here.\nThe diving environment is limited by accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving is done in the shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect equipment configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. [2] Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. [3] Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team. [4]\nBenign conditions, sometimes also referred to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas. [5]\nOpen water is unrestricted water such as a sea, lake or flooded quarry , where the diver has unobstructed direct vertical access to the surface of the water in contact with the atmosphere. [6]\nOpen-water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air. [7]\nWall diving is done along a near vertical face. Blue-water diving is done in mid-water where the bottom is out of sight of the diver and there may be no fixed visual reference. [8]\nBlack-water diving is mid-water diving at night, particularly on a moonless night. [9] [10]\nAn overhead or penetration diving environment is where the diver enters a space from which there is no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving , wreck diving , ice diving and diving inside or under other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit. [11] [4] [3]\nNight diving can allow the diver to experience a different underwater environment , because many marine animals are nocturnal . [12]\nAltitude diving , for example in mountain lakes, requires modifications to the decompression schedule because of the reduced atmospheric pressure. [13] [14]\nRecreational dive sites [ edit ]\nThe Blue Hole in Dahab, Egypt , a world-renowned recreational dive site\nMain article: Recreational dive sites\nThe common term for a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As a general rule, professional diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which are known for their convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions.\nRecreational dive sites  – Places that divers go to enjoy the underwater environment\nIndex of recreational dive sites  – Alphabetical listing of articles on porular places for recreational diving\nInland dive sites – Dive sites in bodies of water other than the sea\nCoastal dive sites – Dive sites near a coast of the body of water\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCoral reef  – Outcrop of rock in the sea formed by the growth and deposit of stony coral skeletons\nLake  – Large body of relatively still water\nMuck diving  – Recreational diving on a loose sedimentary bottom\nQuarry dive sites  – Disused and flooded quarry repurposed for underwater diving\nRocky reef  – Natural reef of rock\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nDiver training sites [ edit ]\nSee also: Diver training § Training venues for diving skills\nDiver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the environmental risk is relatively low. [15]\nSwimming pool  – Artificial water basin for swimming\nDiver training tank  – Tank of water to practice diving skills\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nHyperbaric treatment and transport environments [ edit ]\nPhysiologically and legally a compression in a diving chamber is considered a dive. Various options for hypebaric transport and treatment exist, each with its own characteristics, applications and operational procedures.\nClosed bell  – Hyperbaric chamber for transporting divers vertically through the water\nHyperbaric stretcher  – Portable pressure vessel to transport a person under pressure.\nHyperbaric lifeboat  – Lifeboat for transporting people under pressure\nIn-water recompression  – In-water treatment for decompression sickness\nRecompression chamber  – A hyperbaric chamber used to treat divers suffering from decompression illness\nEnvironments by confinement [ edit ]\nConfinement can influence diver safety and the ability of the diver to perform the required task. Some types of confinement improve safety by limiting the ability of the diver to move into higher risk areas, others limit the ability of the diver to maneuver or to escape to a place of safety in an emergency.\nConfined space  – Space with limited entry and egress and not suitable for human inhabitants\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training. The Queensland government define confined water for recreational diving purposes as \"Water which offers pool-like conditions, good visibility, and water which is shallow enough so that all divers can stand up with their heads well clear of the water\". [16] Other definitions do not require such shallow depth, but may have a depth restriction.\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nPenetration diving , also known as overhead environments – Diving under a physical barrier to a direct vertical ascent to the surface\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCavern diving  – Diving in the part of a cave where the exit is visible by natural light\nCulvert  – Structure to channel water past an obstacle\nIce diving  – Underwater diving under ice\nIntake  – Opening or structure through which a fluid is admitted into a space or machine\nPenstock  – Intake structure that controls water flow to turbines or sewerage systems\nOverhang  – Rocky part protruding from a cliff – A topographical feature which is open to one side, but obstructed overhead, and deep enough for a diver to be under the overhang.\nRestriction  – Space through which it is possible to pass with some difficulty – Space through which it is possible for a diver to pass with some difficulty. Section of a cave which is difficult to pass through due to lack of space. A minor restriction is too small for two divers to swim through together, a major restriction requires the diver to remove equipment to fit through. [17]\nSewerage  – Infrastructure that conveys sewage or surface runoff using sewers\nSwim-through  – Short underwater tunnel with adequate clearance and obvious exit – Arch, or short, clear tunnel that has sufficient space to allow a diver to swim through and where the light of the opening at the far end is visible through the hole.\nUnder ships – usually for inspection, maintenance and repair, or incidentally, when diving from one. In some cases the gap between the ship and the bottom or the jetty or dock can be quite small.\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nEnvironments by visibility [ edit ]\nVisibility in the diving medium directly affects diver safety and the ability to complete useful tasks. In some cases this can be mitigated by technology to improve visibility, but often the task procedures must be modified to suit the capacity of the diver, and the diver must have training and equipment bto deal with emergencies under more difficult circumstances.\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nLow visibility diving\nSilt out  – Reduction of underwater visibility by disturbing silt deposits\nNight diving  – Underwater diving during the hours of darkness\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nEnvironments by hazard [ edit ]\nBesides the hazards associated with the underwater environment itself, there are a considerable variety of hazard types and risk levels to which a diver may be exposed due to the circumstances of the dive task. Many of these are normally only encountered by professional specialists , and the means of reducing risk to an acceptable level may be complex and expensive.\nBenign water  – Diving environment with very low risk\nBomb disposal  – Activity to dispose of and render safe explosive munitions and other materials\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nCombat diving  – Tactical military scuba diving\nCurrents – Water flow in a locally consistent direction\nDelta P environments  – Hazards associated with underwater diving – Environments where a pressure difference causes flow.

[18] The recommended depth limit for more extensively trained recreational divers ranges from 30 metres (98 ft) for PADI divers, [19] (this is the depth at which nitrogen narcosis symptoms generally begin to be noticeable in adults), to 40 metres (130 ft) specified by Recreational Scuba Training Council , [19] 50 metres (160 ft) for divers of the British Sub-Aqua Club and Sub-Aqua Association breathing air, [20] and 60 metres (200 ft) for teams of 2 to 3 French Level 3 recreational divers, breathing air. [21]\nFor technical divers, the recommended maximum depths are greater on the understanding that they will use less narcotic gas mixtures. 100 metres (330 ft) is the maximum depth authorised for divers who have completed Trimix Diver certification with IANTD [22] or Advanced Trimix Diver certification with TDI . [23] 332 metres (1,089 ft) is the world record depth on scuba (2014). [24] Commercial divers using saturation techniques and heliox breathing gases routinely exceed 100 metres (330 ft), but they are also limited by physiological constraints. Comex Hydra 8 experimental dives reached a record open water depth of 534 metres (1,752 ft) in 1988. [25] Atmospheric pressure diving suits are mainly constrained by the technology of the articulation seals, and a US Navy diver has dived to 610 metres (2,000 ft) in one. [26] [27]\nFrom an oceanographic viewpoint:\nShallow water, defined as between the surf-zone and the coast\nIntermediate water, defined as between the surf zone and wave base (where the waves just interact with the bottom and no more, usually about 80 m water depth with 10 second swells). The seafloor beneath intermediate water is termed the shoreface and is the zone where the seafloor slows down the swells by friction, so that the surf ends up being lower than it otherwise would be.\nDeep water, defined as deeper than wave base: i.e. too deep for waves to interact with the seafloor.\nRecreational divers will usually dive in the shallow to intermediate marine environment. Technical and commercial divers may venture into the deep water environment.\nEnvironments by professional activity [ edit ]\nSee also: Professional diving\nAquaculture  – Farming of aquatic organisms\nAquarium  – Transparent tank of water for fish and water-dwelling species\nArchaeological sites  – Place in which evidence of past activity is preserved\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nDeep sea mining , also known as Underwater mining – Mineral extraction from the ocean floor\nDemolition  – Tearing-down of buildings and other structures\nDry dock  – Basin drained to allow work on a vessel\nFish farms  – Raising fish commercially in enclosures\nForensic investigation  – Application of scientific investigation to criminal and civil laws\nInspection  – Organized examination or formal evaluation exercise\nMarine salvage  – Recovering a ship or cargo after a maritime casualty\nMilitary  – Organization primarily tasked with preparing for and conducting war\nMooring  – Structure for securing floating vessels\nSingle buoy mooring , also known as Single point mooring – Offshore mooring buoy with connections for loading or unloading tankers\nNuclear power plant  – Thermal power station where the heat source is a nuclear reactor\nOil rig  – Apparatus constructed for oil drilling\nOil platform , also known as Production platform – Offshore ocean structure with oil drilling and related facilities\nPublic safety diving  – Underwater work done by law enforcement, rescue and search and recovery teams\nScience  – Systematic endeavor for gaining knowledge\nSearch and rescue  – Search for and provision of aid to people who are in distress or imminent danger\nSewage treatment  – Process of removing contaminants from municipal wastewater\nShips husbandry  – Maintenance and upkeep of ships\nSubmarine pipeline  – Pipeline that is laid on the seabed or below it inside a trench\nSurveying  – Science of determining the positions of points and the distances and angles between them\nTraining  – Acquisition of knowledge, skills, and competencies as a result of teaching or practice\nUnderwater construction , also known as Civil engineering – Industrial construction in an underwater environment\nWellhead  – Component at the surface of a well that provides the structural and pressure-containing interface\nDiving medium [ edit ]\nUnderwater environment  – Aquatic or submarine environment\nFresh water  – Naturally occurring water with low amounts of dissolved salts\nPotable water  – Water safe for consumption\nBrackish water  – Water with salinity between freshwater and seawater\nSeawater  – Water from a sea or an ocean\nBrine  – Concentrated solution of salt in water\nContaminated water  – Water containing high levels of hazardous materials\nSewage  – Wastewater that is produced by a community of people\nDrilling fluid , also known as drilling mud – Aid for drilling boreholes into the ground\nPetroleum , also known as crude oil – Naturally occurring flammable liquid\nFuel oil  – Petroleum product burned to generate motive power or heat\nReferences [ edit ]\n^\nDiving Regulations 2009 .

It is usually underwater , but professional diving is sometimes done in other liquids. Underwater diving is the human practice of voluntarily descending below the surface of the water to interact with the surroundings, for various recreational or occupational reasons, but the concept of diving also legally extends to immersion in other liquids, and exposure to other pressurised environments. [1] Some of the more common diving environments are listed and defined here.\nThe diving environment is limited by accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving is done in the shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect equipment configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. [2] Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. [3] Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team. [4]\nBenign conditions, sometimes also referred to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas. [5]\nOpen water is unrestricted water such as a sea, lake or flooded quarry , where the diver has unobstructed direct vertical access to the surface of the water in contact with the atmosphere. [6]\nOpen-water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air. [7]\nWall diving is done along a near vertical face. Blue-water diving is done in mid-water where the bottom is out of sight of the diver and there may be no fixed visual reference. [8]\nBlack-water diving is mid-water diving at night, particularly on a moonless night. [9] [10]\nAn overhead or penetration diving environment is where the diver enters a space from which there is no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving , wreck diving , ice diving and diving inside or under other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit. [11] [4] [3]\nNight diving can allow the diver to experience a different underwater environment , because many marine animals are nocturnal . [12]\nAltitude diving , for example in mountain lakes, requires modifications to the decompression schedule because of the reduced atmospheric pressure. [13] [14]\nRecreational dive sites [ edit ]\nThe Blue Hole in Dahab, Egypt , a world-renowned recreational dive site\nMain article: Recreational dive sites\nThe common term for a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As a general rule, professional diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which are known for their convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions.\nRecreational dive sites  – Places that divers go to enjoy the underwater environment\nIndex of recreational dive sites  – Alphabetical listing of articles on porular places for recreational diving\nInland dive sites – Dive sites in bodies of water other than the sea\nCoastal dive sites – Dive sites near a coast of the body of water\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCoral reef  – Outcrop of rock in the sea formed by the growth and deposit of stony coral skeletons\nLake  – Large body of relatively still water\nMuck diving  – Recreational diving on a loose sedimentary bottom\nQuarry dive sites  – Disused and flooded quarry repurposed for underwater diving\nRocky reef  – Natural reef of rock\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nDiver training sites [ edit ]\nSee also: Diver training § Training venues for diving skills\nDiver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the environmental risk is relatively low. [15]\nSwimming pool  – Artificial water basin for swimming\nDiver training tank  – Tank of water to practice diving skills\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nHyperbaric treatment and transport environments [ edit ]\nPhysiologically and legally a compression in a diving chamber is considered a dive. Various options for hypebaric transport and treatment exist, each with its own characteristics, applications and operational procedures.\nClosed bell  – Hyperbaric chamber for transporting divers vertically through the water\nHyperbaric stretcher  – Portable pressure vessel to transport a person under pressure.\nHyperbaric lifeboat  – Lifeboat for transporting people under pressure\nIn-water recompression  – In-water treatment for decompression sickness\nRecompression chamber  – A hyperbaric chamber used to treat divers suffering from decompression illness\nEnvironments by confinement [ edit ]\nConfinement can influence diver safety and the ability of the diver to perform the required task. Some types of confinement improve safety by limiting the ability of the diver to move into higher risk areas, others limit the ability of the diver to maneuver or to escape to a place of safety in an emergency.\nConfined space  – Space with limited entry and egress and not suitable for human inhabitants\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training. The Queensland government define confined water for recreational diving purposes as \"Water which offers pool-like conditions, good visibility, and water which is shallow enough so that all divers can stand up with their heads well clear of the water\". [16] Other definitions do not require such shallow depth, but may have a depth restriction.\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nPenetration diving , also known as overhead environments – Diving under a physical barrier to a direct vertical ascent to the surface\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCavern diving  – Diving in the part of a cave where the exit is visible by natural light\nCulvert  – Structure to channel water past an obstacle\nIce diving  – Underwater diving under ice\nIntake  – Opening or structure through which a fluid is admitted into a space or machine\nPenstock  – Intake structure that controls water flow to turbines or sewerage systems\nOverhang  – Rocky part protruding from a cliff – A topographical feature which is open to one side, but obstructed overhead, and deep enough for a diver to be under the overhang.\nRestriction  – Space through which it is possible to pass with some difficulty – Space through which it is possible for a diver to pass with some difficulty. Section of a cave which is difficult to pass through due to lack of space. A minor restriction is too small for two divers to swim through together, a major restriction requires the diver to remove equipment to fit through. [17]\nSewerage  – Infrastructure that conveys sewage or surface runoff using sewers\nSwim-through  – Short underwater tunnel with adequate clearance and obvious exit – Arch, or short, clear tunnel that has sufficient space to allow a diver to swim through and where the light of the opening at the far end is visible through the hole.\nUnder ships – usually for inspection, maintenance and repair, or incidentally, when diving from one. In some cases the gap between the ship and the bottom or the jetty or dock can be quite small.\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nEnvironments by visibility [ edit ]\nVisibility in the diving medium directly affects diver safety and the ability to complete useful tasks. In some cases this can be mitigated by technology to improve visibility, but often the task procedures must be modified to suit the capacity of the diver, and the diver must have training and equipment bto deal with emergencies under more difficult circumstances.\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nLow visibility diving\nSilt out  – Reduction of underwater visibility by disturbing silt deposits\nNight diving  – Underwater diving during the hours of darkness\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nEnvironments by hazard [ edit ]\nBesides the hazards associated with the underwater environment itself, there are a considerable variety of hazard types and risk levels to which a diver may be exposed due to the circumstances of the dive task. Many of these are normally only encountered by professional specialists , and the means of reducing risk to an acceptable level may be complex and expensive.\nBenign water  – Diving environment with very low risk\nBomb disposal  – Activity to dispose of and render safe explosive munitions and other materials\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nCombat diving  – Tactical military scuba diving\nCurrents – Water flow in a locally consistent direction\nDelta P environments  – Hazards associated with underwater diving – Environments where a pressure difference causes flow.

[18] The recommended depth limit for more extensively trained recreational divers ranges from 30 metres (98 ft) for PADI divers, [19] (this is the depth at which nitrogen narcosis symptoms generally begin to be noticeable in adults), to 40 metres (130 ft) specified by Recreational Scuba Training Council , [19] 50 metres (160 ft) for divers of the British Sub-Aqua Club and Sub-Aqua Association breathing air, [20] and 60 metres (200 ft) for teams of 2 to 3 French Level 3 recreational divers, breathing air. [21]\nFor technical divers, the recommended maximum depths are greater on the understanding that they will use less narcotic gas mixtures. 100 metres (330 ft) is the maximum depth authorised for divers who have completed Trimix Diver certification with IANTD [22] or Advanced Trimix Diver certification with TDI . [23] 332 metres (1,089 ft) is the world record depth on scuba (2014). [24] Commercial divers using saturation techniques and heliox breathing gases routinely exceed 100 metres (330 ft), but they are also limited by physiological constraints. Comex Hydra 8 experimental dives reached a record open water depth of 534 metres (1,752 ft) in 1988. [25] Atmospheric pressure diving suits are mainly constrained by the technology of the articulation seals, and a US Navy diver has dived to 610 metres (2,000 ft) in one. [26] [27]\nFrom an oceanographic viewpoint:\nShallow water, defined as between the surf-zone and the coast\nIntermediate water, defined as between the surf zone and wave base (where the waves just interact with the bottom and no more, usually about 80 m water depth with 10 second swells). The seafloor beneath intermediate water is termed the shoreface and is the zone where the seafloor slows down the swells by friction, so that the surf ends up being lower than it otherwise would be.\nDeep water, defined as deeper than wave base: i.e. too deep for waves to interact with the seafloor.\nRecreational divers will usually dive in the shallow to intermediate marine environment.

It is usually underwater , but professional diving is sometimes done in other liquids. Underwater diving is the human practice of voluntarily descending below the surface of the water to interact with the surroundings, for various recreational or occupational reasons, but the concept of diving also legally extends to immersion in other liquids, and exposure to other pressurised environments. [1] Some of the more common diving environments are listed and defined here.\nThe diving environment is limited by accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving is done in the shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect equipment configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. [2] Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. [3] Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team. [4]\nBenign conditions, sometimes also referred to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas. [5]\nOpen water is unrestricted water such as a sea, lake or flooded quarry , where the diver has unobstructed direct vertical access to the surface of the water in contact with the atmosphere. [6]\nOpen-water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air. [7]\nWall diving is done along a near vertical face. Blue-water diving is done in mid-water where the bottom is out of sight of the diver and there may be no fixed visual reference. [8]\nBlack-water diving is mid-water diving at night, particularly on a moonless night. [9] [10]\nAn overhead or penetration diving environment is where the diver enters a space from which there is no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving , wreck diving , ice diving and diving inside or under other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit. [11] [4] [3]\nNight diving can allow the diver to experience a different underwater environment , because many marine animals are nocturnal . [12]\nAltitude diving , for example in mountain lakes, requires modifications to the decompression schedule because of the reduced atmospheric pressure. [13] [14]\nRecreational dive sites [ edit ]\nThe Blue Hole in Dahab, Egypt , a world-renowned recreational dive site\nMain article: Recreational dive sites\nThe common term for a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As a general rule, professional diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which are known for their convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions.\nRecreational dive sites  – Places that divers go to enjoy the underwater environment\nIndex of recreational dive sites  – Alphabetical listing of articles on porular places for recreational diving\nInland dive sites – Dive sites in bodies of water other than the sea\nCoastal dive sites – Dive sites near a coast of the body of water\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCoral reef  – Outcrop of rock in the sea formed by the growth and deposit of stony coral skeletons\nLake  – Large body of relatively still water\nMuck diving  – Recreational diving on a loose sedimentary bottom\nQuarry dive sites  – Disused and flooded quarry repurposed for underwater diving\nRocky reef  – Natural reef of rock\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nDiver training sites [ edit ]\nSee also: Diver training § Training venues for diving skills\nDiver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the environmental risk is relatively low. [15]\nSwimming pool  – Artificial water basin for swimming\nDiver training tank  – Tank of water to practice diving skills\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nHyperbaric treatment and transport environments [ edit ]\nPhysiologically and legally a compression in a diving chamber is considered a dive. Various options for hypebaric transport and treatment exist, each with its own characteristics, applications and operational procedures.\nClosed bell  – Hyperbaric chamber for transporting divers vertically through the water\nHyperbaric stretcher  – Portable pressure vessel to transport a person under pressure.\nHyperbaric lifeboat  – Lifeboat for transporting people under pressure\nIn-water recompression  – In-water treatment for decompression sickness\nRecompression chamber  – A hyperbaric chamber used to treat divers suffering from decompression illness\nEnvironments by confinement [ edit ]\nConfinement can influence diver safety and the ability of the diver to perform the required task. Some types of confinement improve safety by limiting the ability of the diver to move into higher risk areas, others limit the ability of the diver to maneuver or to escape to a place of safety in an emergency.\nConfined space  – Space with limited entry and egress and not suitable for human inhabitants\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training. The Queensland government define confined water for recreational diving purposes as \"Water which offers pool-like conditions, good visibility, and water which is shallow enough so that all divers can stand up with their heads well clear of the water\". [16] Other definitions do not require such shallow depth, but may have a depth restriction.\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nPenetration diving , also known as overhead environments – Diving under a physical barrier to a direct vertical ascent to the surface\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCavern diving  – Diving in the part of a cave where the exit is visible by natural light\nCulvert  – Structure to channel water past an obstacle\nIce diving  – Underwater diving under ice\nIntake  – Opening or structure through which a fluid is admitted into a space or machine\nPenstock  – Intake structure that controls water flow to turbines or sewerage systems\nOverhang  – Rocky part protruding from a cliff – A topographical feature which is open to one side, but obstructed overhead, and deep enough for a diver to be under the overhang.\nRestriction  – Space through which it is possible to pass with some difficulty – Space through which it is possible for a diver to pass with some difficulty. Section of a cave which is difficult to pass through due to lack of space. A minor restriction is too small for two divers to swim through together, a major restriction requires the diver to remove equipment to fit through. [17]\nSewerage  – Infrastructure that conveys sewage or surface runoff using sewers\nSwim-through  – Short underwater tunnel with adequate clearance and obvious exit – Arch, or short, clear tunnel that has sufficient space to allow a diver to swim through and where the light of the opening at the far end is visible through the hole.\nUnder ships – usually for inspection, maintenance and repair, or incidentally, when diving from one. In some cases the gap between the ship and the bottom or the jetty or dock can be quite small.\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nEnvironments by visibility [ edit ]\nVisibility in the diving medium directly affects diver safety and the ability to complete useful tasks. In some cases this can be mitigated by technology to improve visibility, but often the task procedures must be modified to suit the capacity of the diver, and the diver must have training and equipment bto deal with emergencies under more difficult circumstances.\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nLow visibility diving\nSilt out  – Reduction of underwater visibility by disturbing silt deposits\nNight diving  – Underwater diving during the hours of darkness\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nEnvironments by hazard [ edit ]\nBesides the hazards associated with the underwater environment itself, there are a considerable variety of hazard types and risk levels to which a diver may be exposed due to the circumstances of the dive task. Many of these are normally only encountered by professional specialists , and the means of reducing risk to an acceptable level may be complex and expensive.\nBenign water  – Diving environment with very low risk\nBomb disposal  – Activity to dispose of and render safe explosive munitions and other materials\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nCombat diving  – Tactical military scuba diving\nCurrents – Water flow in a locally consistent direction\nDelta P environments  – Hazards associated with underwater diving – Environments where a pressure difference causes flow.

[18] The recommended depth limit for more extensively trained recreational divers ranges from 30 metres (98 ft) for PADI divers, [19] (this is the depth at which nitrogen narcosis symptoms generally begin to be noticeable in adults), to 40 metres (130 ft) specified by Recreational Scuba Training Council , [19] 50 metres (160 ft) for divers of the British Sub-Aqua Club and Sub-Aqua Association breathing air, [20] and 60 metres (200 ft) for teams of 2 to 3 French Level 3 recreational divers, breathing air. [21]\nFor technical divers, the recommended maximum depths are greater on the understanding that they will use less narcotic gas mixtures. 100 metres (330 ft) is the maximum depth authorised for divers who have completed Trimix Diver certification with IANTD [22] or Advanced Trimix Diver certification with TDI . [23] 332 metres (1,089 ft) is the world record depth on scuba (2014). [24] Commercial divers using saturation techniques and heliox breathing gases routinely exceed 100 metres (330 ft), but they are also limited by physiological constraints. Comex Hydra 8 experimental dives reached a record open water depth of 534 metres (1,752 ft) in 1988. [25] Atmospheric pressure diving suits are mainly constrained by the technology of the articulation seals, and a US Navy diver has dived to 610 metres (2,000 ft) in one. [26] [27]\nFrom an oceanographic viewpoint:\nShallow water, defined as between the surf-zone and the coast\nIntermediate water, defined as between the surf zone and wave base (where the waves just interact with the bottom and no more, usually about 80 m water depth with 10 second swells). The seafloor beneath intermediate water is termed the shoreface and is the zone where the seafloor slows down the swells by friction, so that the surf ends up being lower than it otherwise would be.\nDeep water, defined as deeper than wave base: i.e. too deep for waves to interact with the seafloor.\nRecreational divers will usually dive in the shallow to intermediate marine environment. Technical and commercial divers may venture into the deep water environment.\nEnvironments by professional activity [ edit ]\nSee also: Professional diving\nAquaculture  – Farming of aquatic organisms\nAquarium  – Transparent tank of water for fish and water-dwelling species\nArchaeological sites  – Place in which evidence of past activity is preserved\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nDeep sea mining , also known as Underwater mining – Mineral extraction from the ocean floor\nDemolition  – Tearing-down of buildings and other structures\nDry dock  – Basin drained to allow work on a vessel\nFish farms  – Raising fish commercially in enclosures\nForensic investigation  – Application of scientific investigation to criminal and civil laws\nInspection  – Organized examination or formal evaluation exercise\nMarine salvage  – Recovering a ship or cargo after a maritime casualty\nMilitary  – Organization primarily tasked with preparing for and conducting war\nMooring  – Structure for securing floating vessels\nSingle buoy mooring , also known as Single point mooring – Offshore mooring buoy with connections for loading or unloading tankers\nNuclear power plant  – Thermal power station where the heat source is a nuclear reactor\nOil rig  – Apparatus constructed for oil drilling\nOil platform , also known as Production platform – Offshore ocean structure with oil drilling and related facilities\nPublic safety diving  – Underwater work done by law enforcement, rescue and search and recovery teams\nScience  – Systematic endeavor for gaining knowledge\nSearch and rescue  – Search for and provision of aid to people who are in distress or imminent danger\nSewage treatment  – Process of removing contaminants from municipal wastewater\nShips husbandry  – Maintenance and upkeep of ships\nSubmarine pipeline  – Pipeline that is laid on the seabed or below it inside a trench\nSurveying  – Science of determining the positions of points and the distances and angles between them\nTraining  – Acquisition of knowledge, skills, and competencies as a result of teaching or practice\nUnderwater construction , also known as Civil engineering – Industrial construction in an underwater environment\nWellhead  – Component at the surface of a well that provides the structural and pressure-containing interface\nDiving medium [ edit ]\nUnderwater environment  – Aquatic or submarine environment\nFresh water  – Naturally occurring water with low amounts of dissolved salts\nPotable water  – Water safe for consumption\nBrackish water  – Water with salinity between freshwater and seawater\nSeawater  – Water from a sea or an ocean\nBrine  – Concentrated solution of salt in water\nContaminated water  – Water containing high levels of hazardous materials\nSewage  – Wastewater that is produced by a community of people\nDrilling fluid , also known as drilling mud – Aid for drilling boreholes into the ground\nPetroleum , also known as crude oil – Naturally occurring flammable liquid\nFuel oil  – Petroleum product burned to generate motive power or heat\nReferences [ edit ]\n^\nDiving Regulations 2009 .

It is usually underwater , but professional diving is sometimes done in other liquids. Underwater diving is the human practice of voluntarily descending below the surface of the water to interact with the surroundings, for various recreational or occupational reasons, but the concept of diving also legally extends to immersion in other liquids, and exposure to other pressurised environments. [1] Some of the more common diving environments are listed and defined here.\nThe diving environment is limited by accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving is done in the shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect equipment configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. [2] Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. [3] Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team. [4]\nBenign conditions, sometimes also referred to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas. [5]\nOpen water is unrestricted water such as a sea, lake or flooded quarry , where the diver has unobstructed direct vertical access to the surface of the water in contact with the atmosphere. [6]\nOpen-water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air. [7]\nWall diving is done along a near vertical face. Blue-water diving is done in mid-water where the bottom is out of sight of the diver and there may be no fixed visual reference. [8]\nBlack-water diving is mid-water diving at night, particularly on a moonless night. [9] [10]\nAn overhead or penetration diving environment is where the diver enters a space from which there is no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving , wreck diving , ice diving and diving inside or under other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit. [11] [4] [3]\nNight diving can allow the diver to experience a different underwater environment , because many marine animals are nocturnal . [12]\nAltitude diving , for example in mountain lakes, requires modifications to the decompression schedule because of the reduced atmospheric pressure. [13] [14]\nRecreational dive sites [ edit ]\nThe Blue Hole in Dahab, Egypt , a world-renowned recreational dive site\nMain article: Recreational dive sites\nThe common term for a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As a general rule, professional diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which are known for their convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions.\nRecreational dive sites  – Places that divers go to enjoy the underwater environment\nIndex of recreational dive sites  – Alphabetical listing of articles on porular places for recreational diving\nInland dive sites – Dive sites in bodies of water other than the sea\nCoastal dive sites – Dive sites near a coast of the body of water\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCoral reef  – Outcrop of rock in the sea formed by the growth and deposit of stony coral skeletons\nLake  – Large body of relatively still water\nMuck diving  – Recreational diving on a loose sedimentary bottom\nQuarry dive sites  – Disused and flooded quarry repurposed for underwater diving\nRocky reef  – Natural reef of rock\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nDiver training sites [ edit ]\nSee also: Diver training § Training venues for diving skills\nDiver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the environmental risk is relatively low. [15]\nSwimming pool  – Artificial water basin for swimming\nDiver training tank  – Tank of water to practice diving skills\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nHyperbaric treatment and transport environments [ edit ]\nPhysiologically and legally a compression in a diving chamber is considered a dive. Various options for hypebaric transport and treatment exist, each with its own characteristics, applications and operational procedures.\nClosed bell  – Hyperbaric chamber for transporting divers vertically through the water\nHyperbaric stretcher  – Portable pressure vessel to transport a person under pressure.\nHyperbaric lifeboat  – Lifeboat for transporting people under pressure\nIn-water recompression  – In-water treatment for decompression sickness\nRecompression chamber  – A hyperbaric chamber used to treat divers suffering from decompression illness\nEnvironments by confinement [ edit ]\nConfinement can influence diver safety and the ability of the diver to perform the required task. Some types of confinement improve safety by limiting the ability of the diver to move into higher risk areas, others limit the ability of the diver to maneuver or to escape to a place of safety in an emergency.\nConfined space  – Space with limited entry and egress and not suitable for human inhabitants\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training. The Queensland government define confined water for recreational diving purposes as \"Water which offers pool-like conditions, good visibility, and water which is shallow enough so that all divers can stand up with their heads well clear of the water\". [16] Other definitions do not require such shallow depth, but may have a depth restriction.\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nPenetration diving , also known as overhead environments – Diving under a physical barrier to a direct vertical ascent to the surface\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCavern diving  – Diving in the part of a cave where the exit is visible by natural light\nCulvert  – Structure to channel water past an obstacle\nIce diving  – Underwater diving under ice\nIntake  – Opening or structure through which a fluid is admitted into a space or machine\nPenstock  – Intake structure that controls water flow to turbines or sewerage systems\nOverhang  – Rocky part protruding from a cliff – A topographical feature which is open to one side, but obstructed overhead, and deep enough for a diver to be under the overhang.\nRestriction  – Space through which it is possible to pass with some difficulty – Space through which it is possible for a diver to pass with some difficulty. Section of a cave which is difficult to pass through due to lack of space. A minor restriction is too small for two divers to swim through together, a major restriction requires the diver to remove equipment to fit through. [17]\nSewerage  – Infrastructure that conveys sewage or surface runoff using sewers\nSwim-through  – Short underwater tunnel with adequate clearance and obvious exit – Arch, or short, clear tunnel that has sufficient space to allow a diver to swim through and where the light of the opening at the far end is visible through the hole.\nUnder ships – usually for inspection, maintenance and repair, or incidentally, when diving from one. In some cases the gap between the ship and the bottom or the jetty or dock can be quite small.\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nEnvironments by visibility [ edit ]\nVisibility in the diving medium directly affects diver safety and the ability to complete useful tasks. In some cases this can be mitigated by technology to improve visibility, but often the task procedures must be modified to suit the capacity of the diver, and the diver must have training and equipment bto deal with emergencies under more difficult circumstances.\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nLow visibility diving\nSilt out  – Reduction of underwater visibility by disturbing silt deposits\nNight diving  – Underwater diving during the hours of darkness\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nEnvironments by hazard [ edit ]\nBesides the hazards associated with the underwater environment itself, there are a considerable variety of hazard types and risk levels to which a diver may be exposed due to the circumstances of the dive task. Many of these are normally only encountered by professional specialists , and the means of reducing risk to an acceptable level may be complex and expensive.\nBenign water  – Diving environment with very low risk\nBomb disposal  – Activity to dispose of and render safe explosive munitions and other materials\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nCombat diving  – Tactical military scuba diving\nCurrents – Water flow in a locally consistent direction\nDelta P environments  – Hazards associated with underwater diving – Environments where a pressure difference causes flow.

[18] The recommended depth limit for more extensively trained recreational divers ranges from 30 metres (98 ft) for PADI divers, [19] (this is the depth at which nitrogen narcosis symptoms generally begin to be noticeable in adults), to 40 metres (130 ft) specified by Recreational Scuba Training Council , [19] 50 metres (160 ft) for divers of the British Sub-Aqua Club and Sub-Aqua Association breathing air, [20] and 60 metres (200 ft) for teams of 2 to 3 French Level 3 recreational divers, breathing air. [21]\nFor technical divers, the recommended maximum depths are greater on the understanding that they will use less narcotic gas mixtures. 100 metres (330 ft) is the maximum depth authorised for divers who have completed Trimix Diver certification with IANTD [22] or Advanced Trimix Diver certification with TDI . [23] 332 metres (1,089 ft) is the world record depth on scuba (2014). [24] Commercial divers using saturation techniques and heliox breathing gases routinely exceed 100 metres (330 ft), but they are also limited by physiological constraints. Comex Hydra 8 experimental dives reached a record open water depth of 534 metres (1,752 ft) in 1988. [25] Atmospheric pressure diving suits are mainly constrained by the technology of the articulation seals, and a US Navy diver has dived to 610 metres (2,000 ft) in one. [26] [27]\nFrom an oceanographic viewpoint:\nShallow water, defined as between the surf-zone and the coast\nIntermediate water, defined as between the surf zone and wave base (where the waves just interact with the bottom and no more, usually about 80 m water depth with 10 second swells). The seafloor beneath intermediate water is termed the shoreface and is the zone where the seafloor slows down the swells by friction, so that the surf ends up being lower than it otherwise would be.\nDeep water, defined as deeper than wave base: i.e. too deep for waves to interact with the seafloor.\nRecreational divers will usually dive in the shallow to intermediate marine environment. Technical and commercial divers may venture into the deep water environment.\nEnvironments by professional activity [ edit ]\nSee also: Professional diving\nAquaculture  – Farming of aquatic organisms\nAquarium  – Transparent tank of water for fish and water-dwelling species\nArchaeological sites  – Place in which evidence of past activity is preserved\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nDeep sea mining , also known as Underwater mining – Mineral extraction from the ocean floor\nDemolition  – Tearing-down of buildings and other structures\nDry dock  – Basin drained to allow work on a vessel\nFish farms  – Raising fish commercially in enclosures\nForensic investigation  – Application of scientific investigation to criminal and civil laws\nInspection  – Organized examination or formal evaluation exercise\nMarine salvage  – Recovering a ship or cargo after a maritime casualty\nMilitary  – Organization primarily tasked with preparing for and conducting war\nMooring  – Structure for securing floating vessels\nSingle buoy mooring , also known as Single point mooring – Offshore mooring buoy with connections for loading or unloading tankers\nNuclear power plant  – Thermal power station where the heat source is a nuclear reactor\nOil rig  – Apparatus constructed for oil drilling\nOil platform , also known as Production platform – Offshore ocean structure with oil drilling and related facilities\nPublic safety diving  – Underwater work done by law enforcement, rescue and search and recovery teams\nScience  – Systematic endeavor for gaining knowledge\nSearch and rescue  – Search for and provision of aid to people who are in distress or imminent danger\nSewage treatment  – Process of removing contaminants from municipal wastewater\nShips husbandry  – Maintenance and upkeep of ships\nSubmarine pipeline  – Pipeline that is laid on the seabed or below it inside a trench\nSurveying  – Science of determining the positions of points and the distances and angles between them\nTraining  – Acquisition of knowledge, skills, and competencies as a result of teaching or practice\nUnderwater construction , also known as Civil engineering – Industrial construction in an underwater environment\nWellhead  – Component at the surface of a well that provides the structural and pressure-containing interface\nDiving medium [ edit ]\nUnderwater environment  – Aquatic or submarine environment\nFresh water  – Naturally occurring water with low amounts of dissolved salts\nPotable water  – Water safe for consumption\nBrackish water  – Water with salinity between freshwater and seawater\nSeawater  – Water from a sea or an ocean\nBrine  – Concentrated solution of salt in water\nContaminated water  – Water containing high levels of hazardous materials\nSewage  – Wastewater that is produced by a community of people\nDrilling fluid , also known as drilling mud – Aid for drilling boreholes into the ground\nPetroleum , also known as crude oil – Naturally occurring flammable liquid\nFuel oil  – Petroleum product burned to generate motive power or heat\nReferences [ edit ]\n^\nDiving Regulations 2009 .

It is usually underwater , but professional diving is sometimes done in other liquids. Underwater diving is the human practice of voluntarily descending below the surface of the water to interact with the surroundings, for various recreational or occupational reasons, but the concept of diving also legally extends to immersion in other liquids, and exposure to other pressurised environments. [1] Some of the more common diving environments are listed and defined here.\nThe diving environment is limited by accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving is done in the shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect equipment configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. [2] Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. [3] Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team. [4]\nBenign conditions, sometimes also referred to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas. [5]\nOpen water is unrestricted water such as a sea, lake or flooded quarry , where the diver has unobstructed direct vertical access to the surface of the water in contact with the atmosphere. [6]\nOpen-water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air. [7]\nWall diving is done along a near vertical face. Blue-water diving is done in mid-water where the bottom is out of sight of the diver and there may be no fixed visual reference. [8]\nBlack-water diving is mid-water diving at night, particularly on a moonless night. [9] [10]\nAn overhead or penetration diving environment is where the diver enters a space from which there is no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving , wreck diving , ice diving and diving inside or under other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit. [11] [4] [3]\nNight diving can allow the diver to experience a different underwater environment , because many marine animals are nocturnal . [12]\nAltitude diving , for example in mountain lakes, requires modifications to the decompression schedule because of the reduced atmospheric pressure. [13] [14]\nRecreational dive sites [ edit ]\nThe Blue Hole in Dahab, Egypt , a world-renowned recreational dive site\nMain article: Recreational dive sites\nThe common term for a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As a general rule, professional diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which are known for their convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions.\nRecreational dive sites  – Places that divers go to enjoy the underwater environment\nIndex of recreational dive sites  – Alphabetical listing of articles on porular places for recreational diving\nInland dive sites – Dive sites in bodies of water other than the sea\nCoastal dive sites – Dive sites near a coast of the body of water\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCoral reef  – Outcrop of rock in the sea formed by the growth and deposit of stony coral skeletons\nLake  – Large body of relatively still water\nMuck diving  – Recreational diving on a loose sedimentary bottom\nQuarry dive sites  – Disused and flooded quarry repurposed for underwater diving\nRocky reef  – Natural reef of rock\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nDiver training sites [ edit ]\nSee also: Diver training § Training venues for diving skills\nDiver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the environmental risk is relatively low. [15]\nSwimming pool  – Artificial water basin for swimming\nDiver training tank  – Tank of water to practice diving skills\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nHyperbaric treatment and transport environments [ edit ]\nPhysiologically and legally a compression in a diving chamber is considered a dive. Various options for hypebaric transport and treatment exist, each with its own characteristics, applications and operational procedures.\nClosed bell  – Hyperbaric chamber for transporting divers vertically through the water\nHyperbaric stretcher  – Portable pressure vessel to transport a person under pressure.\nHyperbaric lifeboat  – Lifeboat for transporting people under pressure\nIn-water recompression  – In-water treatment for decompression sickness\nRecompression chamber  – A hyperbaric chamber used to treat divers suffering from decompression illness\nEnvironments by confinement [ edit ]\nConfinement can influence diver safety and the ability of the diver to perform the required task. Some types of confinement improve safety by limiting the ability of the diver to move into higher risk areas, others limit the ability of the diver to maneuver or to escape to a place of safety in an emergency.\nConfined space  – Space with limited entry and egress and not suitable for human inhabitants\nConfined water  – A diving environment that is enclosed and bounded sufficiently for safe training. The Queensland government define confined water for recreational diving purposes as \"Water which offers pool-like conditions, good visibility, and water which is shallow enough so that all divers can stand up with their heads well clear of the water\". [16] Other definitions do not require such shallow depth, but may have a depth restriction.\nOpen water  – Unrestricted water with direct vertical access to the surface in contact with the atmosphere\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nPenetration diving , also known as overhead environments – Diving under a physical barrier to a direct vertical ascent to the surface\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nCavern diving  – Diving in the part of a cave where the exit is visible by natural light\nCulvert  – Structure to channel water past an obstacle\nIce diving  – Underwater diving under ice\nIntake  – Opening or structure through which a fluid is admitted into a space or machine\nPenstock  – Intake structure that controls water flow to turbines or sewerage systems\nOverhang  – Rocky part protruding from a cliff – A topographical feature which is open to one side, but obstructed overhead, and deep enough for a diver to be under the overhang.\nRestriction  – Space through which it is possible to pass with some difficulty – Space through which it is possible for a diver to pass with some difficulty. Section of a cave which is difficult to pass through due to lack of space. A minor restriction is too small for two divers to swim through together, a major restriction requires the diver to remove equipment to fit through. [17]\nSewerage  – Infrastructure that conveys sewage or surface runoff using sewers\nSwim-through  – Short underwater tunnel with adequate clearance and obvious exit – Arch, or short, clear tunnel that has sufficient space to allow a diver to swim through and where the light of the opening at the far end is visible through the hole.\nUnder ships – usually for inspection, maintenance and repair, or incidentally, when diving from one. In some cases the gap between the ship and the bottom or the jetty or dock can be quite small.\nWreck diving  – Recreational diving on wrecks\nEnvironments by visibility [ edit ]\nVisibility in the diving medium directly affects diver safety and the ability to complete useful tasks. In some cases this can be mitigated by technology to improve visibility, but often the task procedures must be modified to suit the capacity of the diver, and the diver must have training and equipment bto deal with emergencies under more difficult circumstances.\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nLow visibility diving\nSilt out  – Reduction of underwater visibility by disturbing silt deposits\nNight diving  – Underwater diving during the hours of darkness\nBlack-water diving  – Open ocean mid-water diving at night\nEnvironments by hazard [ edit ]\nBesides the hazards associated with the underwater environment itself, there are a considerable variety of hazard types and risk levels to which a diver may be exposed due to the circumstances of the dive task. Many of these are normally only encountered by professional specialists , and the means of reducing risk to an acceptable level may be complex and expensive.\nBenign water  – Diving environment with very low risk\nBomb disposal  – Activity to dispose of and render safe explosive munitions and other materials\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nCombat diving  – Tactical military scuba diving\nCurrents – Water flow in a locally consistent direction\nDelta P environments  – Hazards associated with underwater diving – Environments where a pressure difference causes flow.

Arbitrarily specified at below 10 °C for some training standards\nDiving in freezing water – Water where surface layers are at or very near freezing point.\nEnvironments by geography [ edit ]\nThe geographical location of a dive site can have legal or environmental consequences.\nTropical diving – Diving in tropical waters\nTemperate water diving – Diving in temperate waters\nPolar diving - Diving in polar waters\nAltitude diving  – Underwater diving at altitudes above 300 m\nCave diving  – Diving in water-filled caves\nDrift diving  – Scuba diving where the diver is intentionally transported by the water flow\nInland diving  – Diving in waters inland of the coastal high water mark.\nReef diving\nArtificial reef  – Human-made underwater structure that functions as a reef\nCoral reef  – Outcrop of rock in the sea formed by the growth and deposit of stony coral skeletons\nRocky reef  – Natural reef of rock\nInshore diving  – Diving in coastal territorial waters\nOffshore diving  – Diving outside the territorial waters of a country\nOpen ocean diving  – Diving in deep water out of sight of land\nEnvironments by topography [ edit ]\nBlue-water diving  – Underwater diving in oceanic mid-water where the bottom is not visible and is out of diving range\nCave  – Natural underground space large enough for a human to enter\nCulvert  – Structure to channel water past an obstacle\nDam  – Barrier that stops or restricts the flow of surface or underground streams\nDeep diving  – Underwater diving to a depth beyond the norm accepted by the associated community\nFlooded mine  – Excavation for mineral extraction filled by water\nFlooded quarries  – Disused and flooded quarry repurposed for underwater diving\nIce diving  – Underwater diving under ice\nLake  – Large body of relatively still water\nMid-water  – At a depth away from surface and bottom – Away from any fixed solid reference points.\nMuck diving  – Recreational diving on a loose sedimentary bottom\nReef  – A shoal of rock, coral or other sufficiently coherent material, lying beneath the surface of water\nArtificial reef  – Human-made underwater structure that functions as a reef\nCoral reef  – Outcrop of rock in the sea formed by the growth and deposit of stony coral skeletons\nRocky reef  – Natural reef of rock\nRiver  – Natural flowing watercourse\nReservoir  – Storage space for water\nSump  – Low part of a volume that collects liquid by gravity\nSump (cave)  – Passage in a cave that is submerged under water\nTunnel  – Underground passage made for traffic\nWall diving  – Underwater diving alongside a near vertical face\nWater tank  – Container for storing water\nEnvironments by depth zone [ edit ]\nSee also: Deep diving\nA technical diver using a closed circuit rebreather with open circuit bailout cylinders returns from a 600-foot (180 m) dive.\nThe recreational diving depth limit set by the EN 14153-2 / ISO 24801-2 level 2 \" Autonomous Diver \" standard is 20 metres (66 ft). [18] The recommended depth limit for more extensively trained recreational divers ranges from 30 metres (98 ft) for PADI divers, [19] (this is the depth at which nitrogen narcosis symptoms generally begin to be noticeable in adults), to 40 metres (130 ft) specified by Recreational Scuba Training Council , [19] 50 metres (160 ft) for divers of the British Sub-Aqua Club and Sub-Aqua Association breathing air, [20] and 60 metres (200 ft) for teams of 2 to 3 French Level 3 recreational divers, breathing air. [21]\nFor technical divers, the recommended maximum depths are greater on the understanding that they will use less narcotic gas mixtures. 100 metres (330 ft) is the maximum depth authorised for divers who have completed Trimix Diver certification with IANTD [22] or Advanced Trimix Diver certification with TDI . [23] 332 metres (1,089 ft) is the world record depth on scuba (2014). [24] Commercial divers using saturation techniques and heliox breathing gases routinely exceed 100 metres (330 ft), but they are also limited by physiological constraints. Comex Hydra 8 experimental dives reached a record open water depth of 534 metres (1,752 ft) in 1988. [25] Atmospheric pressure diving suits are mainly constrained by the technology of the articulation seals, and a US Navy diver has dived to 610 metres (2,000 ft) in one. [26] [27]\nFrom an oceanographic viewpoint:\nShallow water, defined as between the surf-zone and the coast\nIntermediate water, defined as between the surf zone and wave base (where the waves just interact with the bottom and no more, usually about 80 m water depth with 10 second swells). The seafloor beneath intermediate water is termed the shoreface and is the zone where the seafloor slows down the swells by friction, so that the surf ends up being lower than it otherwise would be.\nDeep water, defined as deeper than wave base: i.e. too deep for waves to interact with the seafloor.\nRecreational divers will usually dive in the shallow to intermediate marine environment. Technical and commercial divers may venture into the deep water environment.\nEnvironments by professional activity [ edit ]\nSee also: Professional diving\nAquaculture  – Farming of aquatic organisms\nAquarium  – Transparent tank of water for fish and water-dwelling species\nArchaeological sites  – Place in which evidence of past activity is preserved\nClearance diving  – Military diving work involving underwater demolition and work with explosives\nDeep sea mining , also known as Underwater mining – Mineral extraction from the ocean floor\nDemolition  – Tearing-down of buildings and other structures\nDry dock  – Basin drained to allow work on a vessel\nFish farms  – Raising fish commercially in enclosures\nForensic investigation  – Application of scientific investigation to criminal and civil laws\nInspection  – Organized examination or formal evaluation exercise\nMarine salvage  – Recovering a ship or cargo after a maritime casualty\nMilitary  – Organization primarily tasked with preparing for and conducting war\nMooring  – Structure for securing floating vessels\nSingle buoy mooring , also known as Single point mooring – Offshore mooring buoy with connections for loading or unloading tankers\nNuclear power plant  – Thermal power station where the heat source is a nuclear reactor\nOil rig  – Apparatus constructed for oil drilling\nOil platform , also known as Production platform – Offshore ocean structure with oil drilling and related facilities\nPublic safety diving  – Underwater work done by law enforcement, rescue and search and recovery teams\nScience  – Systematic endeavor for gaining knowledge\nSearch and rescue  – Search for and provision of aid to people who are in distress or imminent danger\nSewage treatment  – Process of removing contaminants from municipal wastewater\nShips husbandry  – Maintenance and upkeep of ships\nSubmarine pipeline  – Pipeline that is laid on the seabed or below it inside a trench\nSurveying  – Science of determining the positions of points and the distances and angles between them\nTraining  – Acquisition of knowledge, skills, and competencies as a result of teaching or practice\nUnderwater construction , also known as Civil engineering – Industrial construction in an underwater environment\nWellhead  – Component at the surface of a well that provides the structural and pressure-containing interface\nDiving medium [ edit ]\nUnderwater environment  – Aquatic or submarine environment\nFresh water  – Naturally occurring water with low amounts of dissolved salts\nPotable water  – Water safe for consumption\nBrackish water  – Water with salinity between freshwater and seawater\nSeawater  – Water from a sea or an ocean\nBrine  – Concentrated solution of salt in water\nContaminated water  – Water containing high levels of hazardous materials\nSewage  – Wastewater that is produced by a community of people\nDrilling fluid , also known as drilling mud – Aid for drilling boreholes into the ground\nPetroleum , also known as crude oil – Naturally occurring flammable liquid\nFuel oil  – Petroleum product burned to generate motive power or heat\nReferences [ edit ]\n^\nDiving Regulations 2009 .
