Wreck diving is an incredible way to witness firsthand this history lost to the waves. Fortunately — for divers, anyway — there is no shortage of shipwrecks to scuba dive! But remember: going inside a wreck safely requires special training.

Water saps heat from the body faster than air, so even in relatively warm waters, prolonged exposure can lead to cold hands. In cold water dives, gloves help prevent hypothermia.\nGloves are mandatory when diving in super cold waters like here in Antarctica .\nAbrasion and Cut Protection : Underwater environments, like coral reefs, shipwrecks, or rocky terrains, can be rough and sharp. Gloves protect divers’ hands from cuts, scrapes, and abrasions.\nProtection Against Marine Life : Some marine organisms can be harmful upon contact. For instance, fire coral, certain jellyfish, or spiny sea urchins can sting or puncture the skin. Wearing gloves provides an additional layer of protection against such encounters.\nImproved Grip : Handling equipment underwater, especially metallic objects, can be slippery. Gloves often have textured surfaces that enhance grip, ensuring better handling of items like cameras, torches, or tools.\nProtection from Contaminants : In certain diving environments, like polluted waters or specific cave systems, there might be potential contaminants. Gloves act as a barrier, protecting hands from direct exposure.\nReduced Risk of Infection : Any cut or abrasion, even minor ones, can become infected when exposed to seawater. Wearing gloves reduces the risk of initial injury and, consequently, potential infections.\nGloves protect you when you leave the water over rocks like here.\nIncreased Confidence : For new divers, wearing gloves can provide an added sense of security, allowing them to be more confident and less tentative during their dives.\nHowever, it’s essential to remember that while gloves offer protection, divers should still be cautious and respectful of their environment. Avoid unnecessary contact with marine life and be aware of buoyancy to minimize disturbance to the underwater world.\nHow to pick the right diving gloves\nWhen buying a pair of diving gloves, here are a few things to consider.\n1. Right Fit\nEnsure the gloves fit snugly but not too tight. A very tight glove can restrict blood flow, making your hands colder. Conversely, a loose glove can let in water, negating its insulating properties.\n2. Thickness\nGlove thickness, usually measured in millimeters (mm) is the main factor to keep your hands warm. Similar to dive boots , a 1-2mm glove is ideal for tropical waters, while 5mm and above is suited for cold water .\nRemember though that some countries forbid the use of (thick) diving gloves!\n3. Seams\nSealed seams prevent water ingress, providing better insulation. Look for gloves with glued and blind-stitched seams for cold water dives.\n4. Wrist Closure\nGloves with adjustable wrist straps offer a more customized fit, preventing water from flushing in and out of the glove. This usually means they are warmer, however, it also makes them a bit more bulky to carry in your suitcase.\n5. Grip\nMany gloves come with textured palms or finger surfaces to improve grip on equipment. If you are an underwater photographer , you might want one that gives you a bitter grip on your underwater camera equipment.\nOn the other hand, if you want to stay as warm as possible, you could opt for some that have the greatest thickness and ditch the extra grip.\n6. Materials\nPick the right material for your diving gloves. We’ll look at the different materials below.\n7. 3-Finger vs. 5-Finger Style\nThere are diving gloves with 3-finger (Mitt Style) designs, and those with 5. Whichever you prefer depends on what you want to do underwater.\nLet’s look at this in a bit more detail next.\n3-Finger vs. 5-Finger Style Diving Gloves\nThe choice between 3-finger and 5-finger diving gloves depends largely on the specific requirements of the diver and the diving conditions. Cold water divers might lean towards 3-finger gloves for the added warmth, while those needing precise dexterity should opt for the 5-finger design.\n3-Finger (Mitt Style) Diving Gloves\nPros:\nWarmth : By keeping three fingers together, they share warmth, which makes these gloves ideal for colder conditions. The reduced surface area helps to retain heat better than individual finger compartments.\nSimplicity : Fewer individual finger compartments often mean fewer seams, which can sometimes translate to a lower likelihood of leaks or damage.\nDurability : Due to the reduced number of seams and compartments, 3-finger gloves can offer enhanced durability, especially in challenging environments.\nCons:\nDexterity : The most evident drawback is reduced dexterity. Handling equipment, adjusting settings, or performing intricate tasks can be challenging.\nFit : For those unused to the design, it can feel strange or even uncomfortable initially, especially if the glove doesn’t fit perfectly.\nAdaptation : There might be a learning curve, particularly for tasks requiring fine motor skills like operating a camera or adjusting small equipment.\n5-finger diving gloves are more common.\n5-Finger Diving Gloves\nPros:\nDexterity : These gloves allow for greater flexibility and control, making it easier to handle equipment, use tools, or perform detailed tasks underwater.\nNatural Feel : The design is akin to regular gloves, offering a more intuitive and comfortable feel for most divers.\nVersatility : Suitable for various activities, from casual dives to technical dives where manipulating equipment is critical.\nCons:\nWarmth : They might not retain warmth as efficiently as 3-finger gloves because each finger is isolated, leading to more surface area exposed to cold water.\nMore Seams : With more compartments comes more seams, which can potentially be weak points where water can seep in or where the glove can wear out.\nBulkiness : Some 5-finger gloves, especially those designed for cold water, can be bulkier and might restrict movement more than 3-finger gloves of a similar thickness.\nDiving Glove Materials\nThere are different diving glove materials, although neoprene is the most commonly used one.\nNeoprene\nNeoprene is the most commonly used material for any scuba gear . Wetsuits , boots , and hoods are also usually made from it.\nPros:\nProvides excellent insulation, making it perfect for cold water dives.\nFlexible, ensuring comfort and better hand movement underwater.\nCons:\nCan wear out faster when used in rough terrains.\nMight not provide enough protection against sharp objects.\nKevlar\nPros:\nHighly puncture and cut-resistant, ideal for wreck diving or diving in areas with sharp corals.\nDurable and long-lasting.\nCons:\nMight not offer as much thermal protection as neoprene gloves.\nGenerally more expensive.\nAmara (Synthetic Leather)\nPros:\nLightweight and offers decent protection against abrasions.\nDries quickly and is less prone to retaining odors.\nCons:\nLess thermal insulation compared to neoprene.\nNot as cut-resistant as Kevlar.\nDry Gloves\nIf you use a drysuit , you will inevitably come across dry gloves, too.\nDry gloves keep your hands dry but not warm. Similar to a trilaminate drysuit.\nIn return, they offer enough space to put on extra warm wool or other thick gloves.\nDry gloves are great in combination with a drysuit .\nDiving Gloves\nThe best diving gloves in 2024\nWhy wear diving gloves underwater?\nHow to pick the right diving gloves\n3-Finger vs. 5-Finger Style Diving Gloves\nDiving Glove Materials\nDry Gloves\nMake the most out of every dive\nJoin more than 21,300 readers on our email list for more tips & tricks!

Since up to 50% of body heat can be lost through the head, a hood is particularly vital in colder waters to prevent hypothermia.\nThey are usually worn over your exposure suit, however, sometimes they’re already attached.\nHeat Retention: In cold environments, maintaining your body temperature is critical. Even in relatively warm waters, prolonged exposure can sap your warmth.\nProtection: Apart from thermal advantages, hoods protect the head from cuts, scrapes, and stings from marine life or the underwater environment.\nA hood will keep you safe and warm underwater.\nPrevention: Another benefit of wearing a diving hood is that they can prevent ear infections. While your ears will still get wet underneath, larger particles and most of the water are kept out.\nWe also have another guide on keeping your ears safe and healthy during a dive!\nThe best diving hoods in 2024\nXcel Drylock: Known for its great seal and thermal lining.\nO’Neill Psycho Hood: A favorite for its comfortable fit and durable design.\nCressi 5mm Hood: Offers a great balance of warmth and flexibility.\nFourth Element 5mm Hood: Noted for its ergonomic design and thermal performance.\nBare 7mm Coldwater Hood: Perfect for extremely cold environments.\nSeac Tekno 5mm\nSeac Tekno 5mm\nAqualung SemiDry 5mm\nAqualung SemiDry 5mm\nHow to choose a diving hood\nThickness: The colder the water, the thicker your hood should be. Common thicknesses are 3mm, 5mm, and 7mm.\nSeams: Look for glued and blind-stitched seams. They’re more watertight and durable.\nCoverage: Consider whether you want a full-face, open-face, or vest-integrated hood. Your choice will depend on the environment you’re diving in and your personal preference.\nA hood should always be worn over your mask to prevent leakages.\nTips and Tricks to Using a Hood Underwater\nFit is King: Ensure your hood fits snugly but not too tight. It should create a seal without causing a headache.\nVenting: Some hoods come with a vent system to allow trapped air (from your ears) to escape. Ensure these are not blocked.\nEqualizing: When diving, remember to equalize your ears. A well-fitted hood shouldn’t impede this, but be aware of potential challenges.\nCare and Maintenance: Rinse your hood with fresh water after every dive. Dry it inside out first to prevent mold or mildew.\nStorage: Store it away from direct sunlight and avoid folding it to prevent creases or damage to the material.\nDiving Hoods\nWhy should you wear a diving hood?\nThe best diving hoods in 2024\nSeac Tekno 5mm\nAqualung SemiDry 5mm\nHow to choose a diving hood\nTips and Tricks to Using a Hood Underwater\nMake the most out of every dive\nJoin more than 21,300 readers on our email list for more tips & tricks!

It initially catered to cave divers due to its flexibility and increased maneuverability but has become popular among recreational divers, as well.\nSidemount diving was developed in the cave diving community where it allowed divers to pass through narrow passages moe easily than with a fixed backmount setup. Now appeals to the broader diving community, offering unique advantages in terms of flexibility, mobility, and safety.\nDivers use a special sidemount harness to which a tank can be attached to either side.\nSidemount diving is not only great for cave diving!\nWhy you should try out Sidemount diving\nFirst off, it’s fun!\nSidemount diving gives you a new perspective on diving and feels great!\nInstead of carrying heavy tanks on your back, you can simply attach them when you get in the water.\nThe sidemount configuration also offers a distinct set of advantages over traditional backmount diving in many situations:\nComfort : The weight distribution on the body is more balanced, reducing stress on the back, making long dives more comfortable.\nAccessibility : The ease with which tanks can be attached even in the water makes sidemount diving often more convenient. This can be particularly beneficial in locations with challenging entry points where carrying a back-mounted tank is cumbersome.\nFlexibility : Sidemount configuration provides enhanced maneuverability, particularly in tight spaces. This is invaluable in environments like caves or shipwrecks.\nRedundancy : The independent air sources can be a lifesaver if one malfunctions, offering an additional layer of safety.\nHowever, there are also some disadvantages:\nExtra equipment required: Unfortunately, you can’t just attach your tanks to your old BCD and call it a day. Instead, you need to buy a special sidemount harness and straps for your tanks.\nWorks best with two tanks: To achieve a symmetric trim, two tanks are optimal. That also means you need to carry two tanks (and get them filled beforehand) on each dive.\nDifficulty on boats: Many liveaboard ships have limited space. Be sure to tell the operator beforehand that you plan on diving sidemount!\nUse cases of Sidemount diving\nSidemount diving is not just for cave diving (though it excels at that)! Here are some use cases for sidemount setups:\nRecreational Diving : For those who prize comfort and the freedom to move, sidemount offers an unmatched experience.\nTechnical Diving : Sidemount configurations are great for technical diving, and you will often find a combination of back- and sidemount tanks here.\nPhotographers and Videographers : The agility and stability offered by sidemount is perfect for underwater photography , providing the ease to get into the perfect position for that great shot.\nWreck and Cave Diving : Cave diving is where sidemount is king. Especially in the cenotes and other large cave systems, it makes moving through narrow passages far easier!\nSidemount diving equipment\nThe right equipment is crucial for a successful sidemount dive. You will at least need the following equipment pieces:\nSidemount Harness : Unlike traditional BCDs , this harness is tailored for sidemount diving, featuring multiple attachment points for equipment and weight systems.\nBCD : A BCD designed for sidemount will have bladder systems tailored for the unique weight distribution and buoyancy challenges of the configuration.\nRegulators : Each cylinder requires its regulator , ensuring that there’s always a backup available.\nTanks : Typically, divers use one or two smaller cylinders, but technical dives might require more.\nGauges : Each tank should have its own SPG (Submersible Pressure Gauge).\nHoses : Sidemount diving often requires longer hoses to facilitate easy swapping and sharing between regulators, especially in emergencies.\nSidemount-ready tanks at one of our pool practices!\nHow to Get Started with Sidemount Diving\nThe easiest way to become a sidemount diver is by taking a training course!\nDiving agencies globally, from PADI to SSI, offer specialized sidemount diving courses. These courses cover equipment setup, dive techniques, and safety procedures unique to sidemount diving.\nBefore you do, however, you should already have an Open Water certification or better Advanced Open Water Diver.\nAfter that, it’s as usual: Practice makes perfect!\nConclusion\nSidemount diving is a great way of exploring caves, but not only.\nIf you haven’t done so yet, you should try it!\nSidemount Diving\nWhat is Sidemount Diving?\nWhy you should try out Sidemount diving\nUse cases of Sidemount diving\nSidemount diving equipment\nHow to Get Started with Sidemount Diving\nConclusion\nMake the most out of every dive\nJoin more than 21,300 readers on our email list for more tips & tricks!

Welcome friend and enter! We got amazing views, lots of scuba gear to buy, endless decompression times, and cookies. Yes, we got cookies, too!\nExploring shallow reefs, easy wrecks, or taking guided ocean dives all fall under the category of recreational diving.\nThis is what all scuba divers start out with when they first get scuba certified and most stay with it their entire life.\nHowever, very advanced aspects of scuba diving require further diving courses and technical training.\nAmong them are dark caverns and caves, advanced decompression dives, the use of mixed gases, and rebreathers.\nThis is called technical diving and is reserved for the most elite scuba divers.\nIf you are looking to get started with technical diving or just want to know more about it, read on!\nTechnical Diving – Table of Contents\nWhat is technical diving?\nTypes of Technical Diving\nRecreational vs. Technical Diving\nHow to get started with technical diving?\nScuba Gear for Technical Diving\nTechnical Diving Training Organizations\nTechnical Diving Certifications and Training\nPopular Technical Dive Sites\nShould I learn tech diving with PADI, SSI, or other large agencies?\nIs tech diving dangerous?\nIs tech diving expensive?\nConclusion\nWhat is technical diving?\nTechnical diving, also called tech diving, includes advanced aspects of scuba diving such as caves, advanced decompression, wrecks, and the use of mixed gases, or rebreathers. It requires additional training and procedures\nbeyond the scope of recreational diving and should only be done by experienced divers.\nYou might have come across a group of tech divers when diving in your local lakes setting up literal boatloads of dive equipment .\nOr maybe they were on your last liveaboard diving cruise and talked about MOD, EAP, gradient factors, and their special x/35 blend.\nTechnical diving is essentially anything that goes above and beyond the limitations set by recreational scuba training organizations.\nMost noticeably this refers to all and any dives which require mandatory decompression stops , but also special equipment or environments.\nTech diving often requires double tanks and other extra equipment.\nTypes of Technical Diving\nLet’s look at the parts that may fall under technical diving.\nDecompression Diving\nDecompression diving refers to all dives that exceed our non-decompression limits and require mandatory decompression stops during the ascent.\nAs you learned in your recreational diving courses, we load up on nitrogen during a dive by breathing in compressed air at higher pressures than at the surface.\nDuring the ascent, the dissolved gas has to leave our body. If we ascend too fast, meaning we decrease the ambient pressure too quickly, we might suffer from decompression illness or the bends, which manifests in gas bubbles in our tissues.\nYou need a technical dive computer for decompression diving.\nDecompression diving encompasses any dive in which we knowingly and purposefully exceed our non-decompression limits (NDL) and plan in decompression stops.\nSuch stops may take only a few minutes up to hours on end. It’s best to use a special tech-ready dive computer in such cases.\nIt is often combined with mixed-gas diving.\nMixed Gas Diving\nMixed gas diving refers to the use of different breathing gases in our scuba tanks during a dive. This allows us to dive deeper, longer, or decrease decompression times.\nMixed gas diving usually refers to any dive with Nitrox above 50% O2 content, as well as any Trimix, Heliox, or other mixtures.\nAs you learned in your Open Water Diver course or Nitrox specialty, oxygen starts to become toxic between 1.4 and 1.6 bar .\nDue to the rising pressure underwater, and the subsequent increase in partial pressures , this happens around 56m/184ft or 66m/217ft, respectively.\nIn order to exceed these diving depths and to dive hundreds of meters deep, we use different gases depending on our target MOD (maximum operating depth).\nIn mixed gas diving we use different tanks for each gas mixture we carry underwater.\nIn addition, we can replace Nitrogen with Helium to prevent to negative effects of nitrogen narcosis underwater.\nTherefore, divers came up with different gas mixtures like Trimix or Heliox which refers to different compositions and ratios of Oxygen, Helium, and Nitrogen in our breathing gases.\nCave Diving\nCave diving refers to all diving activities in caves, caverns, mines, and other overhead areas that do not allow direct vertical ascent and often lack natural daylight.\nCave diving is my absolute favorite part of scuba diving and exploring these underwater wonders is truly breathtaking (well…maybe not).\nThere are countless underwater caves in the world, and it is one of the areas of diving where there is still a lot left to explore. As such, there is always a chance to be the first person diving at a spot without a line.\nCave diving is my favorite aspect of scua diving.\nSome people differentiate between cave diving , and technical diving, as they require different (but sometimes overlapping) skill sets.\nFor example, some caves do not necessarily require mixed gas diving or decompression procedures, while deep diving does not require line management.\nTherefore, cave diving and technical diving must be trained separately and require different courses. It goes without saying that the skills can often overlap, however.\nCaverns are a special case of caves that are still filled with natural daylight and some scuba training organizations offer recreational caver diver certifications.\nMines, caves, and wrecks to some extent are among the most challenging and difficult environments you can encounter while diving and if you are not training in it, PLEASE do not ever attempt such a dive.\nPlease DO NOT dive in caves without sufficient certification.\nClosed Circuit Rebreather Diving\nClosed Circuit Rebreathers (CCR) filter, enrich and recirculate the breathing air of a diver underwater which allows for extended dive times, and short to no decompression times. It is also heavily utilized by military personnel.\nRebreathers are very different from all other types of diving and generally differ from other technical diving areas.\nInstead of releasing bubbles like normal scuba regulato rs, CCR apparatuses filter the breathed-out air and lead it through a filter where it is enriched with oxygen before it can be breathed in again by the diver.\nThis has a few implications:\nRebreathers don’t release any bubbles\nOur lungs cannot be used to control our buoyancy\nShorter decompression times\nLess gas consumption (cheaper diving)\nSince the gas is recycled, rebreathers release near to no bubbles, making it the equipment of choice for most military divers in the world.\nSince the absolute amount of gas in our lungs and equipment remains near-constant (and as such our scuba weight ), we cannot use our breathing to control buoyancy as we are used to in classic scuba diving.\nRebreather diving is usually something for the “hardcore techies”.\nModern systems also provide gas at depth-dependent partial rations which shortens or removes any decompression obligations.\nRebreather diving requires additional courses, and usually, divers get certified for the apparatus they own.\nThis also means this type of diving follows its own course progression, and technical dive training on a backmount-kit will not prepare you for the same diving on a rebreather.\nRecreational vs. Technical Diving\nTechnical diving includes all areas of diving beyond the limitations set specifically for recreational sports diving.\nTechnical diving is a broad term and encompasses a large number of diving techniques as we saw above.\nHere is a broad comparison between the two:\nRecreational Diving Technical Diving Max depth 40m/120ft No Limit Dive times Limited by NDL (non-decompression limit) No Limit Gases used Air, Nitrox up to 40% O2 Nitrox up to 100% O2, Trimix, any other Dive computer Any Decompression & gas change ready Tank setup Mono Mono, doubles + stages Potential dangers Barotrauma, DCS, Nitrogen Narcosis DCS, oxygen toxicity, High-Pressure Nervous syndrome, depth-related issues\nComparison Recreational vs Technical Diving.\nBefore the rise of recreational diving as a mainstream sport, there were no differences, as all scuba divers were explorers in their own right. Nowadays, we have a different curriculum for recreational and technical diving courses.\nHowever, it can still be a little difficult to exactly determine when something is considered tech diving.\nFor example, diving to 30m / 100ft is well within the scope of recreational divers once they get their Advanced Open Water Diver certification.\nIf we do the same dive using stage bottles, and Nitrox or Trimix, we could call this technical diving but it doesn’t necessarily require different techniques. Only once we get into extended decompression procedures, most divers would define this as tech diving.\nAS you can see, recreational and technical divers can dive at the same dive sites.\nOn the other hand, deep diving to 80m / 240ft is done with mixed gases and Trimix. Diving this deep always requires advanced decompression and can safely be called technical diving.\nAs you see, in order to be tech diving you need to do so with intent and with the right dive equipment .\nHow to get started with technical diving?\nTechnical diving requires great scuba diving skills, excellent buoyancy, and sound knowledge of diving theory to get started. Most tech diving training organizations offer so-called “fundamentals of tech” courses which include the basics of decompression diving, gas changes, and advanced diving skills. In addition, tech diving-ready scuba gear is required.\nBefore you ever consider becoming a technical diver, it’s important to be a good recreational diver first.\nFar too often, new divers are drawn to the promise of greater depth and adrenaline before they have a sufficient number of dives to start their tech diving journey.\nThere are different technical diving training organizations but they all offer something of a “ fundamentals ” course.\nYour tech dive training depends on what interests you most.\nThis is usually required to get started, but depending on the instructor and your previous certification level, you might be able to skip it.\nSome things every tec diver should know are:\nBasics of decompression procedures\nGas blending\nStage handling underwater\nHandling advanced scuba gear\nPlanning a decompression dive\nAfter you have taken your first steps into this exciting new world of diving, you can then proceed with whatever interests you most.\nDo you want to explore the depths of the ocean?\nThen extend your knowledge on advanced Trimix and deep diving methods.\nFeel more like diving in exciting caves, mines, or quarries?\nIn that case, a cave diving certification could be just the right step to take next.\nScuba Gear for Technical Diving\nTechnical diving requires more complex and redundant equipment configurations compared to recreational diving. Not only to dive deeper but also because technical dive sites are often more challenging.\nOf course, your specific configuration depends on the type of tech diving you’re planning to do and the environment.\nThere are also different setups depending on the “philosophy” or training agency you follow. We’ll look at those later.\nTwin Tanks or Sidemount Configuration:\nMany tech divers utilize twin tanks connected with a manifold. They provide much more breathing gas, however, are also a lot heavier. To provide sufficient lift capacity, we need BCDs with bigger air bladders.\nAlternatively, sidemount diving involves wearing one or two tanks on the side.\nIt’s a bit different from the rest on this list, so we created an extra guide to sidemount diving for you!\nTechnical Dive Computer\nThese computers are built to handle multiple gas mixes and allow divers to switch gases during a dive.\nCheck out our list of the best dive computers in 2024 for our top choices!\nDouble-valve Regulator\nA redundant scuba regulator set includes separate or redundant first stages for double tank valves. They are another fail-safe system in case on regulator or valve freezes or experiences malfunction.\nTechnical divers seem to LOVE low-visibility waters!\nRedundant Air Source\nThis could be a completely independent tank or a pony bottle attached to the main tank. Not all tech divers use this but it’s definitely useful to have!\nDecompression Cylinders\nFor staged decompression, decompression cylinders contain different gas mixes like pure oxygen or Nitrox. Usually, these stage bottles are carried by the diver, but sometimes they can be attached to a rope or line underwater.\nBackplate / Wing BCD\nA backplate/wing (BP/W) combo is essentially a modular type of BCD with a back-inflate bladder. They are used by backmount divers, so you’ll find different configurations for sidemount and rebreather divers .\nEven recreational divers can benefit from the improved buoyancy and better trim a backplate wing BCD offers.\nA basic Backplate/Wing BCD setup.\nBackup Masks, Computers, etc.\nFor redundancy in case of equipment failure, tech divers often carry spare versions of many essential equipment pieces. Masks are often carried in drysuit pockets, whereas backup computers are worn on the wrist as usual.\nDrysuit\nDrysuits are very useful when diving deeper or longer. That’s why they’re the preferred choice for most technical divers, even when diving in hot places like Florida or the Cenotes in Mexico.\nRead our guide to drysuits to find out more about the different types and best models.\nRebreathers\nRebreathers filter exhaled gas, thereby removing carbon dioxide and adding fresh oxygen, and making it breathable again. This allows divers to stay underwater much much longer and produce fewer – aka no – bubbles.\nRead our guide to rebreather diving to learn more about them!\nUnderwater Lighting\nPowerful torches for deep and dark environments are a must-have for tech divers. They can be either hand-held or wrist-mounted.\nSMB (Surface Marker Buoy)\nSurface marker buoys are important even for recreational divers, but even more so for technical diving. When taking long decompression stops, they indicate to boats around to keep a safe distance.\nTechnical Diving Training Organizations\nThese are the most popular and well-known accredited tech diving organizations in the world:\nGUE – Global Underwater Explorers\nGUE is generally regarded as the most elite or rather elitist of all technical diving organizations and prides itself on the quality of their instructors.\nTo get started with GUE courses, taking a Fundamentals “Fundi” course is mandatory no matter what previous certifications you hold.\nThis also goes for dive instructors and even divers with previous technical dive training with other agencies.\nGUE has exceptional training quality, especially in cave diving. However, this comes at a high price tag as their dive instructors are in high demand.\nVisit their website: www.gue.com\nIANTD – International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers\nIANTD provided the first Nitrox certification in the world in 1985 and has been on the forefront of mixed gas diving ever since.\nVisit their website: www.iantd.com\nTDI – Technical Diving International\nTDI is the technical arm of the STI and TDI scuba agencies.\nThey focus on a more modern, liberal teaching approach and give their dive instructors a lot of freedom to schedule and conduct courses as they see fit.\nVisit their website: www.tdisdi.com\nTechnical Diving Certifications and Training\nTechnical diving requires specialized training. Here are some of the paths to becoming a tech diver:\nTech Essentials or Fundamentals\nMost training organizations start with a course on proper diving fundamentals that teaches the handling of technical dive equipment, good trim, and proper decompression procedures.\nAdvanced Nitrox and Decompression Procedures\nThis is often the first step to “actual” tech diving, teaching divers about using with different gas mixes and executing decompression stops.\nTrimix Diving\nTrimix is a mix of oxygen, nitrogen, and helium (hence the “tri”) commonly used for deep diving. Similar to Nitrox diving, it requires special training.\nAdvanced Trimix\nFor extreme depths beyond what is covered in the initial trimix course, advanced trimix courses allow divers to use different mixtures.\nCave and Cavern Diving\nCave diving requires specialized courses for diving in overhead environments. These are separate from the “normal” tech diving path but often overlap.\nRebreather Training\nAll rebreather diving is considered tech diving. In contrast to other training courses, rebreather training is limited to the specific model you are using, as well as divided into different depth ratings.\nPopular Technical Dive Sites\nYou can tech dive pretty much anywhere in the world. Here are some great, well-known dive sites for tech divers.\nFlorida Cave System: Florida is one of the most popular cave diving spots in the world and a heaven for technical divers\nTruk Lagoon : Located in Micronesia, it’s a graveyard for Japanese WWII ships.\nThe Red Sea Wrecks : Egypt has several deep wrecks like the SS Thistlegorm. The deeper parts can only be explored by technical divers.\nCenotes : These underwater caves in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula are another cave diving heaven.\nShould I learn tech diving with PADI, SSI, or other large agencies?\nWhile most scuba training agencies nowadays have a technical arm, it is recommended to get certified by an organization specialized in technical diving. Not only do they usually have stricter requirements for both instructors and students in their courses, but they also focus entirely on technical diving instead of also catering to recreational divers.\nIn my very personal opinion, you should NOT learn technical diving with PADI, SSI, NAUI, or any other mainstream agency .\nThey do have tec programs, however, it’s not their only focus.\nJust look at the best and most accomplished technical divers in the world and see where they got their certifications from…or where they teach.\nAs always:\nThe instructor matters more than the training agency.\nIs tech diving dangerous?\nTechnical diving is the most dangerous of all types of scuba diving and bears many more risks than recreational diving. Especially cave diving and ultra-deep diving have higher mortality rates than any other watersport. However, by diving conservatively, sticking to the rules of diving, and good dive planning, the risk can be greatly reduced.\nIt’s not that bad. 😉\nIs tech diving expensive?\nYes.

Encounters with barracudas are the order of the day here.\nEl Toro\nThe rock El Toro in the southwest of Port Adriano and Santa Ponsa is a fascinating dive site. There are also many barracudas and groupers here.\nCabrera\nThe island of Cabrera is also a nature park. Mainly visited from the diving centers in the south of Mallorca. Only a few diving centers are allowed to dive here.\nReserva Marina de Levant\nThe cheese or Farayo at Font de Sa Cala is one of the most interesting diving spots in the Reserva Marina de Levant on Mallorca’s east coast. Crystal-clear water and a fantastic cave labyrinth promise a unique diving experience.\nDiving Mallorca paradise in the Mediterranean\nDiving Mallorca is a very adventurous marine activity. Not everyone dares to dive into the beautiful marine life. But not everyone knows that life underwater is incredibly serene and beautiful. You almost feel like you are relieved of all the mundane burden of your life and just enjoy the Diving Mallorca . Of course, we need to look at the reality a bit, too, that some are hydrophobic. But with the proper guide, it can be a very enchanting experience altogether.\nMany who only think of mass tourism and Magalluf in Mallorca are often surprised when they see the Mediterranean island for the first time underwater. When you search for one of the most beautiful areas, the diving center Mallorca in the Mediterranean is the one you get connected with.\nIn fact,  the most exciting areas of diving school Mallorca are in Mare Nostrum, thanks to many nature parks and nature reserves. The Mallorcan government has done a great job in recent years to protect Mallorca’s nature and preserve it for future generations.\nEspecially nature parks such as the islands “ Dragonera ,” “ El Toro ,” “ Cabrera ,” or the nature reserves on the east coast of the island such as the “ Reserva Marina de Levant ” north of Font de Sa Cala offer top-class diving Mallorca experiences.\nIncredible and Versatile View of Diving Center Mallorca\nAlready the incredibly versatile underwater landscapes, starting from the turquoise sea over white sandy soil, over the protected Posidonia colonies and bizarre rock formations up to underwater canyons, grottos that look like cathedrals, sunken stalactite caves up to cave labyrinths that cut like a Swiss cheese through the Extending rock is worth many extensive dives. But that’s not all. Anyone who has ever dipped in the middle of a swarm of hundreds of barracudas in the Dragonera Natural Park or at El Toro, or discovered the scorpionfishes on a night dive, will no longer be surprised at the constant encounters with octopuses, stingrays, groupers, moray eels, Conger eels, slipper lobsters, hermit crabs, and lobsters.\nSunfish, dolphins, and occasionally seahorses can be seen if you’re lucky, but keep your eyes peeled in the natural parks since there’s fish soup. Gold stripes, monkfish, gaff mackerel, and, especially in the autumn, massive swarms of tuna and barbed mackerel are all sights to behold, and there are some intriguing wrecks to be located.\nLast year there were some sperm whale sightings before Part de Soller in the north of the island…Everything is possible in the diving center Mallorca.\nIn addition, water temperatures of up to 29 degrees in midsummer make scuba diving a wellness experience for a particular class.\nWith the Atlantic to the north and the Mediterranean to the south, Diving Mallorca offers diverse diving opportunities. From big blue sharks prowling off the rugged northern coast to colorful gorgonians waving gently in the warm, serene waters of the Mediterranean, there’s something to tempt divers of all levels.\nCenters of Diving Mallorca Covering Entire Mediterranean\nDiving Center Mallorca is a very crucial element for any diver.

When choosing diving gloves, consider factors such as thickness, the type of water you'll be diving in (cold or warm), and the renowned brands like Fourth Element, Aqualung, and Waterproof that offer high-quality options. Here's a guide to help you make the best choice:\nThickness :\nWarm Water Diving (Tropical) : In warm waters, such as tropical destinations, you typically need thinner gloves, typically 1mm to 3mm thickness. These gloves provide protection from stinging marine life and minor scrapes while allowing for better dexterity.\nCold Water Diving : In colder waters, you'll want thicker gloves to provide insulation. Thickness can range from 5mm to 7mm or more, depending on the water temperature. Thicker gloves help keep your hands warm in chilly conditions.\nMaterial :\nLook for diving gloves made from high-quality neoprene, which provides both insulation and flexibility. Neoprene gloves are available from Fourth Element, Aqualung, and Waterproof and are known for their durability and comfort.\nFit :\nEnsure a snug but not overly tight fit. Gloves that are too tight can restrict blood flow, leading to cold hands, while those that are too loose can let water in.\nBrands like Fourth Element, Aqualung, and Waterproof offer a range of sizes to help you find the perfect fit.\nFeatures :\nConsider features like reinforced palms for better grip, wrist seals to prevent water entry, and Velcro or zipper closures for easy donning and doffing. These features can enhance your diving experience.\nBrand Reputation :\nBrands like Fourth Element , Aqualung , and Waterproof are known for their quality and innovation in diving gear. Choosing gloves from reputable brands ensures you're investing in reliable and durable equipment.\nPersonal Preference :\nUltimately, your choice may come down to personal preference. Some divers prefer the feel and fit of specific brands or models, so don't hesitate to try different gloves to see which ones work best for you.\nConsider Local Conditions :\nAlways consider the specific conditions of the dive site you'll be visiting. Water temperature can vary even within regions, so research the local conditions to make an informed choice.\nRemember that your comfort and safety are paramount when selecting diving gloves. Prioritize gloves that suit the water temperature you'll be diving in, offer a comfortable fit, and provide the features you need. Brands like Fourth Element, Aqualung, and Waterproof have a range of options to cater to different diving preferences and conditions, so you can trust their gear to enhance your underwater adventures.\nDiving Gear\nDIVING & TECH\nCheck out our scuba diving and technical diving collection.\nScuba Diving Tech Diving\nFOLLOW US\nTwitter\nFacebook\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\nYouTube\nQUICK LINKS\nQUICK LINKS\nScuba Diving Gear\nSnorkelling Gear\nFreediving Gear\nSwimming Gear\nBlog, News & Reviews\nUSEFUL LINKS\nUSEFUL LINKS\nContact Us\nShipping & Delivery\nReturns & Exchanges\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nCONTACT US\nshop@oysterdiving.com 0800 699 0243\nOyster Diving Maritime House, Basin Road North, Hove, East Sussex BN41 1WR\nPayment methods\nAmazon\nAmerican Express\nApple Pay\nDiners Club\nDiscover\nGoogle Pay\nMaestro\nMastercard\nShop Pay\nUnion Pay\nVisa\n© 2024, Oyster Diving Shop\nPowered by Shopify\nSign up and save!\nPromotions, new products, and sales.

Typically, divers use the Valsalva maneuver or other equalization techniques to equalize the pressure in their middle ear space. During this process, the tympanic membrane (commonly known as the eardrum) slightly bulges outward.\nHere's where the hood comes into play. When the ear canal is uncovered, it can easily transmit the pressure changes to the water within the ear canal, allowing it to move and adjust accordingly. However, a dive hood that fits snugly against the outer ear can impede this movement, creating difficulties for the diver attempting to equalize.\nPractical Solutions\nThankfully, there are simple solutions to overcome this hurdle:\nFinger Maneuver: One of the easiest remedies is to insert a finger under the hood near the ear. This small adjustment allows water to move more freely, making it easier to equalize the pressure in the middle ear. Divers often find this technique effective in regaining control over ear equalization.\nStrategic Hood Modification: For those seeking a more permanent solution, some divers choose to modify their dive hoods. This involves cutting a small hole from the inside of the hood near the ear canal. Importantly, this hole should penetrate through the inner lining and the neoprene while leaving the outer fabric or covering intact. This modification facilitates the movement of water with minimal restriction, thereby aiding in the equalization process.\nScuba Diving Essentials\nScuba Fins\nScuba Wetsuits\nSnorkels\nScuba Diving Masks\nWhat Thickness of Diving Hood Should You Choose for Your Dive?\nDiving hoods play a crucial role in ensuring your comfort and safety during underwater adventures. When selecting the right hood, factors like thickness and brand can significantly impact your diving experience. In this guide, we'll help you navigate these choices and recommend popular brands known for their quality hoods—Waterproof, Aqualung, and Fourth Element.\nConsider the Thickness: 2mm, 3mm, 5mm, or 7mm\nThe thickness of your diving hood is a critical factor to consider, as it directly affects your thermal insulation and comfort in various water temperatures:\n2mm Hoods:   These are ideal for warm-water diving in tropical climates. They provide minimal insulation but offer excellent flexibility and freedom of movement.\n3mm Hoods:   Suitable for temperate waters, 3mm hoods provide a balance between warmth and flexibility. They're versatile and can be used in a wide range of diving conditions.\n5mm Hoods:   Designed for cooler waters, 5mm hoods offer substantial insulation, keeping you comfortable during longer dives in colder temperatures. They strike a balance between warmth and mobility.\n7mm Hoods:   If you plan to dive in cold or very cold waters, a 7mm hood is your best choice. It provides maximum insulation but may limit flexibility due to its thickness. However, it's essential for maintaining warmth in extreme conditions.\nTop Hood Brands: Waterproof, Aqualung, and Fourth Element\nNow, let's explore some reputable hood brands known for their quality and innovation:\nWaterproof :   Waterproof is a renowned brand in the diving industry, celebrated for its high-performance diving gear. Their hoods are crafted with precision and advanced materials to ensure excellent thermal protection. Whether you need a 2mm hood for tropical dives or a 7mm hood for extreme cold, Waterproof offers a range of options to suit your needs.\nAqualung :   Aqualung is a trusted name among divers worldwide. Their hoods are designed for comfort and durability, making them suitable for various diving conditions. Aqualung hoods often feature smart design elements like face seals and vent systems to enhance performance.\nFourth Element :   Known for its eco-friendly approach and commitment to sustainability, Fourth Element produces hoods that blend functionality with environmental responsibility. Their hoods are popular among divers who appreciate top-quality gear and eco-conscious choices.\nIn conclusion, choosing the right diving hood involves assessing the water temperature you'll be diving in and considering the thickness that provides the necessary insulation. Additionally, opting for reputable brands like Waterproof, Aqualung, and Fourth Element ensures that your diving hood meets high-quality standards. Dive comfortably, stay warm, and enjoy your underwater adventures with the perfect hood for your needs.\nFOLLOW US\nTwitter\nFacebook\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\nYouTube\nQUICK LINKS\nQUICK LINKS\nScuba Diving Gear\nSnorkelling Gear\nFreediving Gear\nSwimming Gear\nBlog, News & Reviews\nUSEFUL LINKS\nUSEFUL LINKS\nContact Us\nShipping & Delivery\nReturns & Exchanges\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nCONTACT US\nshop@oysterdiving.com 0800 699 0243\nOyster Diving Maritime House, Basin Road North, Hove, East Sussex BN41 1WR\nPayment methods\nAmazon\nAmerican Express\nApple Pay\nDiners Club\nDiscover\nGoogle Pay\nMaestro\nMastercard\nShop Pay\nUnion Pay\nVisa\n© 2024, Oyster Diving Shop\nPowered by Shopify\nSign up and save!\nPromotions, new products, and sales.

Here are the top five questions you should know the answers to before making your purchase.\nWhat is the regulator balanced or unbalanced?\nUnderstanding the regulator's performance rating, such as the breathing resistance, airflow, and work of breathing, helps ensure it meets the necessary standards for a comfortable and reliable diving experience.\nIs the regulator suitable for the diving I am going to be doing?\nDifferent regulators are designed for specific diving environments, such as warm water or cold water. It's essential to choose a regulator that is suitable for the type of diving you plan to engage in to ensure optimal performance.\nIs the regulator adjustable?\nRegulators with adjustable features, like breathing resistance or venturi controls, allow divers to customize their breathing comfort underwater. Knowing if the regulator offers these adjustments can enhance the overall diving experience.\nWhat is the maintenance and service requirement?\nUnderstanding the maintenance and service requirements of a regulator is crucial for its long-term performance. Student divers should know how frequently the regulator needs servicing and if there are any specific maintenance procedures they need to follow.\nIs the regulator compatible with other scuba diving equipment?\nIt is important to check that your dive regulator is compatible with other diving equipment you own or plan to own. A good example of this is ensuring that a regulator has two high pressure ports if you plan to purchase (or have purchased) a transmitter to work with your dive computer. Ensuring that you have the correct hose lengths for your BCD or wing you plan to use.\nBy knowing the answers to these questions, student divers can make an educated choice when selecting a scuba diving regulator that meets their needs, enhances their diving experience, and ensures safety underwater.\nFOLLOW US\nTwitter\nFacebook\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\nYouTube\nQUICK LINKS\nQUICK LINKS\nScuba Diving Gear\nSnorkelling Gear\nFreediving Gear\nSwimming Gear\nBlog, News & Reviews\nUSEFUL LINKS\nUSEFUL LINKS\nContact Us\nShipping & Delivery\nReturns & Exchanges\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nCONTACT US\nshop@oysterdiving.com 0800 699 0243\nOyster Diving Maritime House, Basin Road North, Hove, East Sussex BN41 1WR\nPayment methods\nAmazon\nAmerican Express\nApple Pay\nDiners Club\nDiscover\nGoogle Pay\nMaestro\nMastercard\nShop Pay\nUnion Pay\nVisa\n© 2024, Oyster Diving Shop\nPowered by Shopify\nSign up and save!\nPromotions, new products, and sales.

Here's a guide to help you make the right choice:\nUnderstanding the Role of an Undersuit: An undersuit is a specialized garment worn beneath your wetsuit or drysuit, providing essential insulation and thermal protection to keep you warm and comfortable in cold waters.\nFactors to Consider:\nWater Temperature: Choose the thickness of your undersuit based on the water temperature you'll be diving in.\nDive Duration: Longer dives may require thicker undersuits or layering options.\nBody Type and Metabolism: Consider how your body responds to temperature changes.\nDrysuit or Wetsuit: The type of exposure suit you wear affects your choice of undersuit.\nMoisture Management: Look for undersuits with moisture-wicking properties to keep you dry.\nUndersuit Materials:\nFleece: Great for cold waters and extended dives, offering insulation and moisture-wicking.\nNeoprene: Ideal for milder water temperatures, providing warmth and flexibility.\nThinsulate: Offers a balance between warmth and bulk, with lightweight insulation.\nFinding the Perfect Fit: Ensure your undersuit fits snugly but allows for a full range of motion. Avoid excess material that can trap cold air.\nConsider Layering: Layering different undersuit garments can provide customizable insulation for varying conditions and dive durations.\nSeek Expert Advice: Consult experienced divers or professionals at your local dive shop for personalized guidance.\nIn conclusion, selecting the right undersuit for diving involves considering factors like water temperature, dive duration, body type, and your exposure suit. By exploring different materials and paying attention to fit, you can ensure a cozy and enjoyable diving experience. Your choice of undersuit can make all the difference in keeping you warm and comfortable as you explore the underwater world.\nScuba Diving Essentials\nScuba Fins\nScuba Packages\nScuba Wetsuits\nSnorkels\nFinding the Perfect Diving Undersuit: Typhoon and Fourth Element\nWhen it comes to diving in cold waters, having the right undersuit can mean the difference between an enjoyable dive and one that leaves you shivering. In this guide, we'll explore two reputable brands, Typhoon and Fourth Element, and their offerings to help you choose the perfect undersuit for your diving adventures.\nTyphoon's All-in-One Comfort\nTyphoon offers a range of undersuits designed to keep you warm and snug underneath your drysuit. Their ingenious designs prioritize complete comfort while providing the ultimate in thermal insulation for a cozy experience, whether you're exploring warm or cold waters.\nOne of Typhoon's standout features is the choice between all-in-one undersuits and separates. This versatility allows you to tailor your undersuit to your specific needs. All-in-one undersuits are convenient and offer full-body coverage, while separates give you the flexibility to mix and match top and bottom pieces to achieve the perfect combination of warmth and mobility.\nThese undersuits are engineered with advanced fabrics that have been tested in real diving conditions. They excel at repelling moisture, ensuring that you stay dry even in the most challenging underwater environments. With Typhoon's undersuits, you can dive with confidence, knowing that you'll remain comfortable and warm throughout your adventure.\nFourth Element's Arctic Undersuits\nFourth Element is a brand with a reputation for high-performance diving gear, and their Arctic undersuit is no exception. Backed by years of field testing by industry professionals, including the British Antarctic Survey Dive Team and the Norwegian Navy, the Arctic undersuit is designed using high-tech fabrics that have proven their worth in real diving conditions.\nThe Arctic undersuit boasts two layers of insulation and low bulk fabric, delivering exceptional thermal protection and performance, especially under closer-fitting neoprene drysuits. It's not limited to neoprene suits; in a layering system, the Arctic is also suitable for use underneath membrane and trilaminate suits.\nWhat sets the Arctic apart is its innovative approach to thermal protection. It creates a microclimate around the diver, keeping the body dry and warm. Instead of maximizing the thickness of the layer of air near the skin, it requires less loft by minimizing the movement of air within, reducing the rate of cooling without risking trapped air and preventing the dump valve from releasing.\nAdditionally, the Arctic retains a significant degree of its thermal performance when wet, making it a reliable choice even in the event of drysuit failures. Some divers have completed dives in relative comfort after encountering unexpected leaks, a testament to the Arctic's performance.\nIn conclusion, choosing the perfect diving undersuit is a critical step in ensuring your comfort and safety during cold-water dives.

As I poked around the collections in search of missing items, I stumbled across two fantastic denim diving outfits that originally belonged to Wesley and Constance Mueller. The Muellers were pioneers in the world of underwater photography, beginning in 1934 when there were no commercially produced underwater cameras or housings. Not to be deterred, they fashioned their own equipment, complete with matching denim diving outfits. They sewed lead into their jackets and pants so that they “wouldn’t ride up in the current (McKenney 1981).” They even sewed their initials into the garments, presumably so that they wouldn’t mix them up. Of course, the Muellers weren’t out to make a fashion statement on the bottom of the ocean. In fact, Wesley and Constance rarely saw anyone besides each other on their adventures. They wore the heavy denim to protect themselves from poisonous coral and any underwater creatures with sharp and potentially harmful extremities. Still, they must have known how “cool” they looked.\nWesley and Constance Mueller diving in their denim suits (Bahamas, 1938).\nThe Muellers’ denim suits, now housed in collections at the History of Diving Museum.\nThat got me thinking about the role of fashion in the history of diving and how it has affected the evolution of divewear. I immediately thought of Art McKee (subject of several previous blog entries) and his preference for a Speedo and Converse sneakers (his original “Chucks” are on display at the History of Diving Museum, see photo). They certainly kept him comfortable during his dives, an important factor in diving safety. But what about those of us who aren’t pioneers in the field of diving? What do we like to wear beneath the waves? Well, the answer to that question has changed over the years, as evidenced by these magazine advertisements from old issues of Skin Diver (in the library at HDM).\nOf course, the Muellers and Art McKee didn’t have the luxury of wearing wetsuits in the early days, as they weren’t “officially” invented until 1952 by Hugh Bradner (Taylor 2008). Over the years, as recreational diving became more popular and less expensive, style became an increasingly important component in marketing wetsuits. Let’s face it, everyone wants to look good, especially when they are wearing a skin-hugging neoprene suit. The advertisements above clearly illustrate this, with color and designs increasing significantly over time, until ultimately exploding in a blinding flash of color and hair in the 1980’s. Not everyone prefers a wetsuit (see Jacqueline Bisset in her famous diving outfit from the 1977 film The Deep), but their functionality remains the most important factor in their success, keeping divers and other watersport enthusiasts warm, buoyant and scrape-free.\nSo the question now becomes: what do you like to wear when you dive? Do you have a favorite or funny diving outfit? We want to hear about it! Comment on our blog below or post a picture of your favorite diving outfit to our new Flickr pool! To get the sharing started, here are photos of Erin and I modeling the very latest in wetsuit fashion. Ok, maybe not the very latest…but it certainly beats 1984!\nPost navigation\n← Previous Post\nNext Post →\nFollow/Like Us on YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram for daily updates and recordings of prior presentations.\nHistory Of Diving Museum\n82990 Overseas Hwy, Islamorada, FL 33036\n(305) 664-9737\ninfo@divingmuseum.org\nHours Open 10-5 Daily\nOpen Captioned, Close Captioned and Wheelchair accessible\nThe History of Diving Museum is an independent, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization.

In large part because the scuba diving in Playa del Carmen is acknowledged to be some of the best in the world. Situated on the eastern Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, the city is surrounded by gorgeous beaches where you can do everything from sitting and sipping cocktails to partaking in adventure sports. But Playa del Carmen is the home of the scuba dive. As well as the thrilling opportunities to swim with sea-based marine wildlife of all kinds, even a beginner scuba diving in Playa del Carmen will be able to see amazing sights thanks to the area’s famous cenotes – water-filled sinkholes where the limestone rock of the region has eroded away to form perfect microcosms of almost everything beautiful about Mexico. The glorious light and sun, the deep and often translucent blue waters and the plant and animal life flitting through the depths.\nWhen you’re scuba diving around Playa del Carmen prices vary, but you will almost always get the best deal at the smaller, locally-run dive shops. It always pays to find a local guide who will show you the best spots – and tell you the times to go to the busier but must-see local cenotes so you can visit when it’s quiet.\nScuba Diving in Playa del Carmen – Conditions\nGood diving conditions: all-year-round – both in the ocean & cenotes\nAverage visibility in the ocean: +75 feet (+25 meters)\nAverage visibility in cenotes: Up to 328 feet (100 meters)\nColdest water temp: January – March: 78.8 ºF (26 ºC)\nWarmest water temp: May – November 82-84ºF (28-29 ºC)\nWetsuits (full) rentals: 1,2 inch / 3mm\n \n \n \n \nOcean Dives from Playa del Carmen\nPrices in USD\nTour Duration\nLet’s Go\n1 Ocean Dive\n$154\n8am-12pm\nBook Now\n2 Ocean Dives\n$164\n8am – 1:30pm\nBook Now\n2 Dives Puerto Morelos: Reef & Shipwreck C-56 Mine Sweeper\n$204\n8am -3pm\nBook Now\nCozumel Reef – 2 Dives from Playa del Carmen\n$219\n6:30am – 4pm\nBook Now\nMUSA Cancun Museum 2 dives from Playa Del Carmen\n$224\n9am – 12pm\nBook Now\nAll prices are per person, in a small group of 4 people.

All in all, if you like all things scuba, you will love all things Playa del Carmen.\nShark Diving & Snorkeling in Playa Del Carmen\nOne of the things that attracts divers from all around the world to Playa del Carmen each winter is the unique opportunity to dive with bull sharks .

If you’re in the local area, you can’t leave without swimming with sea turtles, tropical fish, baracudas, etc.\nSnorkel Tours from Playa del Carmen\nPrice in USD\nTour Duration\nGet this tour\n2 Snorkel Locations Tour from Playa\n$ 124\n8am-1:30pm\nBook Now\nGet a Quote\nAll Playa Tours\n \nPuerto Aventuras – tropical fish at the artificial reef\nThe white-sand beaches around Puerto Aventuras are picture postcard-beautiful enough that even if you’re not in Playa del Carmen for the snorkeling they’re still worth a visit. But beneath the waves lie artificial reefs which are home to the area’s diverse marine wildlife, including brightly colored tropical fish, crabs, and even the occasional octopus. This makes it one of the prime Playa del Carmen snorkeling spots – ideal whether you’re a beginner or an experienced diver.\nWe offer trips to all of the best cenotes near Playa del Carmen:\n \n \nOne of the most amazing things to do though is the cenote diving and snorkeling for which the area is probably best known. Only the western hemisphere boasts this as an option, so it’s silly not to take advantage of the opportunity when you’re there! Some of the popular cenotes near Playa del Carmen are Jardin del Eden , Tajma ha , and advanced divers with good buoyancy can also try Cenote Zapote and Maravilla. Most of the other popular   cenote diving locations are closer to Tulum.\nBest cenotes near Playa del Carmen – let’s go scuba diving in cenotes\nExplore the cenotes near Playa del Carmen\nPrice\nDuration\nGet this tour\n2 Cenote Dives from Playa\n204USD\n8am – 2:30pm\nBook Now\nDiscover Scuba Diving: 1 Cenote Dive from Playa\n154USD\n1:30pm – 4:30pm\nBook Now\nDiscover Scuba Diving: 1 Cenote Dive + 1 Ocean Dive from Playa\n214USD\n8am – 1:30pm\nBook Now\nFull Open water course: All 5 Dives + E-learning\n564USD\n2-3 days\nBook Now\nMeeting point is our dive shop in Playa del Carmen All prices are per person, in a small group of 4 people.

The wonderful stalactite formations and thick hydrogen sulfide cloud create some intriguing visual effects which might be enough for most cave divers. But where Maravilla really shines is when the light penetrates the cave when the sun is high in the sky above. It is a still little-visited site which is always worth the trip.\nCenote Zapote (a.k.a. Hell’s Bells)\nSurrounded by a stand of the zapote trees which give it its name, this cenote is often called “Hells Bells” because of the shape of the rock formations within. The shapes of these formations are unique, making Cenote Zapote one of the most stunning local cave diving sites.\nTajma Ha\nYou certainly will not be short of things to see at Tajma Ha. The cave entrance links on to several of the most beautiful local caverns, including the Light Room, Cenote Sugarbowl, Chinese Gardens and Cenote Esmerelda. These attractive names are nothing compared to the stunning reality of the caves themselves. If you have the diving skills, you cannot afford to miss Tajma Ha.\nPonderosa (a.k.a. The Garden of Eden)\nSometimes called El Jardin de Eden, from the surface Cenote Ponderosa looks like a small idyllic lake. You can go snorkelling here and have a one-of-a-kind experience surrounded by the jungle. But beneath the surface, you will pass through the incredible halocline where the fresh and saltwater meet to enter the completely different world below. Diving in the Garden of Eden is ideal for divers of all skill levels. The awe-inspiring light show can be seen even at shallower depths and the cenote never gets particularly deep.\nChac Mool\nChac Mool draws in so many visitors for a number of obvious reasons. In the main dome, the light show from above highlights the trees and branches trailing down into the water and creates a feeling of natural splendour which only grows as you dip beneath the surface. Do not miss the so-called Cavern Zone – it is the perfect spot for lovers of light, collapsed rock formations and views of the mysterious jungle above.\nKukulcan (a.ka. Cenote Cancun or Cenote Riviera Maya)\nPart of the Chac Mool cave system, Kukulcan is the beginner diver’s paradise. The white limestone walls here will glow when you shine your light on them, allowing you to see the stalactites and fossils which can be found in several places within. This is only the smallest wonder in this most beautiful of cenotes, though. The high visibility allows you to witness a truly incredible light show at certain times of day, an iridescent curtain which beams down from above.\nChikin Ha\nChikin Ha is actually the name of a nature park which contains three separate cenotes, of which the translucent waters of Chikin Ha itself are probably the most accessible. Whether you are a keen cave diver wanting to experience everything you have heard the Mexico dive scene has to offer, or you simply want to view some of the natural beauty of cenotes, you will find what you are looking for at Chikin Ha.\nDoing something like a cenote tour of Playa del Carmen will usually be the greatest thing to do. Mainly because only local guides know when the busier times are at the most popular local diving spots – and how best to avoid them. The sights of Gran Cenote , Casa Cenote and Dos Ojos really should not be missed if you are even slightly interested in cenote diving (please mind that these 3 are closer to Tulum). But they are also immensely popular, so getting some local info is always worthwhile.\nYou will also be able to find the secret darlings of the cave diving scene in Riviera Maya with a local guide pointing your way. These are often a little off the beaten path or you’d need to take a short trip to get to them. But trust Koox local guides to take you there, it’s entirely worth it if you prefer having the waters more to yourself and your diving buddies.\n \nCenote snorkeling near Playa del Carmen\n \nCenote Snorkel Tours from Playa del Carmen\nPrice\nTour Duration\nGet this tour\n2 Cenotes Snorkel Tour from Playa\n124USD\n8am-1:30pm\nBook Now\nGet a Quote\nAll Playa Tours\nAs far as cenote snorkeling goes, Playa del Carmen again has some of the best spots in the local area. Be sure to check out: Cenote Azul – amazing blue waters, marine wildlife including fish, turtles and eels and the feeling of being surrounded by greenery in a kind of jungle oasis make this one of the top cenotes in Playa del Carmen to visit for any reason. Cenote Jardin del Eden (Cenote El Jardin) – this beautiful cenote is well named indeed. Jump from the cliffside into the water and you’ll be swimming in one of the most well-developed Playa del Carmen caves. El Jardin has something for everyone – picturesque shallows and deeper caverns can both be found here.\nExplore Ancient Mayan History\nCultural Tours from Playa del Carmen\nPrice\nTour Duration\nGet this tour\nAktun Chacmool & Villa Guadalupe from Playa\n184USD\n8am-5:30pm\nBook Now\nChoj Ha & El Naranjal from Playa\n214USD\n8am-5:30pm\nBook Now\nCoba Ruins & Punta Laguna Spider Monkey Reserve from Playa\n184USD\n8am-5:30pm\nBook Now\nSian Ka’an Biosphere & Muyil Ruins from Playa\n184USD\n8am-1:30pm\nBook Now\nGet a Quote\nAll Playa Tours\n \nThe Ko’ox Diving dive shop gives you the adventure you need in Playa del Carmen Mexico\n \n \n \nIf you are staying in Playa Del Carmen, Ko’ox Diving can take you to all of the most exciting diving and snorkeling locations in the Riviera Maya for free.

A poorly fitted mask can cause discomfort and impair visibility underwater, leading to accidents or injury. It is therefore important to choose the correct scuba diving mask for your individual needs.\nThe first step in selecting the right mask is determining what type of face you have. Different masks are designed for different faces, so choosing one that fits your face shape will ensure maximum comfort when worn. If you have an oval-shaped face, look for a low-volume mask with twin lenses and minimal space between your eyes and the glass; this will reduce drag underwater. Conversely, if you have a round face, opt for a high-volume with single lens mask it's give you a wider field of view.\nHow can I ensure that my scuba mask fits correctly?\nThe next step is to ensure that the mask fits correctly and securely on your face. Start by adjusting the strap so that it sits snugly above your ears. Then, put on the mask and use your fingers to feel for any gaps between the frame and your face; if there are any gaps, adjust the straps until they fit more securely. Finally, take a few breaths through your nose while wearing the mask; if you feel no air leakage then it is likely that the seal is good enough for safe scuba diving!\nIn addition to fit, other factors to consider when choosing a scuba diving mask include the field of vision, material, mask volume, color, and prescription lenses. A broad field of vision is ideal, as it will give you a clear view of your surroundings underwater. Silicone masks are more durable and comfortable, while rubber masks are less expensive. A low volume mask is ideal for scuba diving because it reduces the amount of air you need to equalize, making it easier to clear your ears. The color of the mask is a personal choice, but some colors are more suitable for certain diving conditions. And if you wear glasses, consider getting a mask with prescription lenses or purchasing corrective lenses that can be inserted into the mask.\nUltimately, choosing the right scuba diving mask is crucial for an enjoyable and safe diving experience. Be sure to try on different masks, assess the fit and field of vision, and consider your personal needs and preferences when selecting your mask. With the right mask, you'll be able to fully enjoy your underwater adventures while staying comfortable and safe.\nScuba Diving Essentials\nScuba Fins\nScuba Packages\nScuba Wetsuits\nSnorkels\nShould I buy my own scuba diving mask?\nScuba diving is an exciting and adventurous activity that requires a lot of specialized gear, including a mask. While some divers may be content to use rental masks provided by dive operators, many experienced divers recommend purchasing your own mask. In this article, we'll explore the benefits of owning your own mask and answer some common questions about buying scuba diving masks.\nWhy Should I Buy My Own Scuba Diving Mask?\nThere are several reasons why it's a good idea to invest in your own scuba diving mask :\nFit: A proper fitting mask is essential for comfort and safety while diving. Rental masks may not fit your face perfectly, and can cause leaks or discomfort during your dive.\nSanitation: Rental masks may not be cleaned or sanitized properly between uses, which can lead to the spread of bacteria or viruses.\nFamiliarity: When you own your own mask, you become familiar with it, which can help to reduce anxiety and improve confidence while diving.\nCustomization: Owning your own mask allows you to customize it to fit your specific needs, such as adding prescription lenses or fitting it to your face shape or choos the view you want by using single lens or twin lens.\nLong-term cost: Although buying a mask can be more expensive upfront, it can save you money in the long run. Rental fees for masks can add up quickly, especially if you plan to dive frequently.\nWhat Should I Look for When Buying a Scuba Diving Mask?\nWhen choosing a scuba diving mask, there are several factors to consider:\nFit: The mask should fit snugly but comfortably on your face, without any gaps. Try on different sizes and styles to find the one that fits you best.\nField of view: Look for a mask that provides a wide field of view, so you can see clearly while diving.\nLens type: Scuba diving masks come with single or multiple lenses. Single lens masks offer a wider field of view, while twin lens masks are easier to replace if one lens becomes damaged.\nVolume: The mask volume refers to the amount of air space inside the mask. Low volume masks are easier to clear of water, while high volume masks may provide a more comfortable fit.\nMaterial: Scuba diving masks are typically made from silicone or rubber. Silicone masks are more durable and comfortable, while rubber masks are less expensive.\nIs it Necessary to Buy a High-End Scuba Diving Mask?\nNo, it is not necessary to buy a high-end scuba diving mask. While high-end masks may offer additional features and benefits, such as better optical clarity or a more comfortable fit, there are many quality mid-range masks that are suitable for most divers. It's important to choose a mask that fits well and is made from quality materials, regardless of the price. We offer many brand such as Apeks Masks , Aqualung Masks or Fourth Element Masks .\nCan I Use My Scuba Diving Mask for Snorkeling?\nYes, you can use your scuba diving mask for snorkeling. In fact, many scuba diving masks are also suitable for snorkeling. However, some snorkeling masks may not be suitable for scuba diving, as they may not be able to withstand the increased pressure at deeper depths.\nIn conclusion, purchasing your own scuba diving mask is a smart investment for comfort, safety, and overall enjoyment while diving. By choosing a mask that fits well and is made from quality materials, you can ensure a comfortable and clear view underwater. With so many options available on the market, it's important to take the time to find the right mask for your needs and preferences.\nFOLLOW US\nTwitter\nFacebook\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nTikTok\nYouTube\nQUICK LINKS\nQUICK LINKS\nScuba Diving Gear\nSnorkelling Gear\nFreediving Gear\nSwimming Gear\nBlog, News & Reviews\nUSEFUL LINKS\nUSEFUL LINKS\nContact Us\nShipping & Delivery\nReturns & Exchanges\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nCONTACT US\nshop@oysterdiving.com 0800 699 0243\nOyster Diving Maritime House, Basin Road North, Hove, East Sussex BN41 1WR\nPayment methods\nAmazon\nAmerican Express\nApple Pay\nDiners Club\nDiscover\nGoogle Pay\nMaestro\nMastercard\nShop Pay\nUnion Pay\nVisa\n© 2024, Oyster Diving Shop\nPowered by Shopify\nSign up and save!\nPromotions, new products, and sales.

The Inspiration Recycles the exhaled gas around the “loop,” removing CO2 Carbon Dioxide, replenishes the amount of oxygen, and re-uses the gas for the next breath. Two life support computers called controllers monitor the amount of oxygen in the system called the partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2 orPO2).They add just enough to maintain the desired amount of O2 called the setpoint.This gives a constant amount of O2 irrespective of the depth providing the best possible mixture for the depth.\n2020 Color Vision Display\nThis ultra-bright, high-resolution, full-color computer displays real-time PO2 information from the Oxygen controllers and decompression information with ultra-crisp fonts & icons using state-of-the-art IPS technology which offers brightness and clarity from all viewing angles. It also graphically displays CO2 scrubber usage information and, with a press of a button, can be switched to an in-built compass. It remotely connects through Bluetooth to a PC to download your dive information. Simple menu options allow you to change decompression gradient factors or conservatisms, screen brightness, color scheme, and many other options.\nHow to Choose your Rebreather Counter Lung Options\nAP Diving was the first manufacture to offer a choice of either standard Over the Shoulder (OTS) front or Rear (BMCL) placed counter lungs. Front placed OTS lungs are time-proven and have been the industry standard since 1997. They offer the lowest work of breathing (WOB) of any rebreather counterlung currently available.It has easy to locate manual inflators and an overpressure relief (OPV) dump valve. The Rear placed BMCL has the beast breathing performance in all normal diving positions on and BMCK on the market. It offers a clutter-free chest area most technical divers have become accustomed to. It enables more of a horizontal trim attitude, which streamlines your profile and reduces drag.\nConfiguring The Right Size Unit For Your Diving\nChoosing the right rebreather for you is going to be one of the most important decisions you will make.The Inspiration has three chassis size configurations, XPD, EVP and EVO or Large, Medium and Small. All sizes of units can be configured for purely recreational to full-on technical diving specifications and are all upgradable at any point during your diving progression. The choice of unit chassis size is going to based on a combination of the type of diving you plan to do, who much diving you can drive to verses flying, and your body frame size.\nsize guide\nInspiration XPD\nInspiration EVP\nInspiration EVO\nInspiration XPD\nInspiration EVO\nThe Inspiration EVO is the smaller of the three chassis sizes. It contains 2 x 2-liter steel cylinders, which are smaller cylinders the chassis can carry. The smaller capacity cylinders do not realistically give you a shorter dive duration over the 3-liter cylinders but often means you can need to refill the cylinders at the end of each day’s diving. The unit size better fits smaller framed people. For taller people, the unit sits just above the hips in the lower back. The smaller chassis is easy to fly with than its larger companions. The EVO carries there larger 2 hours* scrubber. There is no difference in pricing for the different sized chassis, and all have a full range of harness sizes from small to XXL.\nInspiration EVP\nInspiration EVP\nThe Inspiration EVP is the medium of the three chassis sizes.

Please check our training section for information on becoming dive certified.\nAmerican Diving has been introducing divers of all skill levels to the Gulf of Mexico waters off the coast of South Padre Island for over 35 years. Our dive boat, the Diver 1, has been specially outfitted for diving in the Gulf of Mexico. To go diving with us, ALL divers must be scuba Certified by an accredited training agency. Advanced level training and capabilities are recommended. Diving in the Gulf of Mexico presents unique challenges for divers. Changing currents, sea conditions and visibility are all things out of our control.\nOur dive sites are located, on average, 15 miles from shore. The Gulf of Mexico is composed on a mud and sand bottom. There are no coral reefs near the shoreline. Therefore, we need structure underwater to have interesting places to dive and attract marine life. Our main dive site is the Texas Clipper, a 450 ft artificial reef located 17 miles from shore. \nRig Dive\nDiving on the Oil Rigs of the Gulf of Mexico\n2 tank trip\n$179.00\n2 Tank Trip\nIncludes Air Tanks\nNitrox $12/cylinder\nBeginner to Advanced\nDepth 30ft - 120ft\nLearn More\nThe Texas Clipper\nThe Premiere Dive in the State of Texas\n2 tank trips\n$189.00\n2 Tank Trip\nIncludes Air tanks\nNitrox $12/cylinder\nAdvanced Dive\nDepth 80ft - 130ft\nLearn More\nRGV Reef\n90 Foot Shrimp Boat part of the RGV Reef\n2 Tank Trip\n$179.00\n2 Tank Trip\nINCLUDES Air TANKS\nNitrox $12/cylinder\nBeginner to Advanced\nDepth 50FT - 70FT\n2021 Dive Season\nThe 2021 dive season at American Diving South Padre Island is scheduled to run from April 3rd  through September 12 .

I am the new intern Jonathon and I will be at the museum through October. During my first week at the museum, the Commercial Diving exhibit caught my eye and I wanted to take a closer look into the field of commercial diving.\nOne of the most unique aspects of commercial diving is its long history. Beginning around the 16th century, people began diving not only to explore the ocean, but for commercial purposes like the salvage of wrecks, retrieving lost cargo, and to repair and maintain underwater structures. Through time, the commercial applications of diving have become known internationally and are currently practiced all over the world. The main “branches” of commercial diving are offshore, inland, scientific and nuclear diving. Offshore and inland diving being the most popular, focus on underwater welding and maintenance. This is why you see most commercial divers working on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and at busy ports throughout the world.\nPublished back on Tuesday, October 2, 2012\nThe Commercial Diving exhibit at HDM\nWhy are they needed ?\nIf you think about it, who in their right mind would want to dive 700 feet underwater in areas not only unknown to humans but also pitch black? In my opinion, this is the most interesting part of commercial diving: trusting your equipment and yourself hundreds of feet underwater while performing tasks that require extreme skill and concentration. With that in mind, commercial divers are also trained as welders and mechanics. In the field of commercial diving, welding is very broad and important. It can consist of welding ships, repairing pipes, welding bridges and many other challenging tasks. To put the importance of commercial divers into perspective, the Golden gate bridge is one of the most beautifully built and well constructed bridges in the world. Many people do not know that it was constructed and is still maintained by commercial divers. Bridges, pipelines, and oil rigs need to be closely watched and maintained and without commercial divers this would be an almost impossible task. The maintenance of bridges, dams and oil rigs requires certain skills that are demanding and difficult – requiring the commercial diver to be a very skilled and knowledgeable individual. As a result, divers in this field are highly sought, extremely valued, and well-paid. Universities all over the world provide programs that give students the skills to become commercial divers. These programs are challenging, difficult and in the end provide sustainable jobs for people around the globe. Kirby Morgan SuperLite\nAt the center of HDM’s Commercial Diving exhibit is a Kirby-Morgan SuperLite. The SuperLite is currently one of the most widely used helmets in commercial diving and has become the industry standard. Considered the most advanced helmet today, it combines many different elements that create comfort and durability for divers. The SuperLite is equipped with a communication system, a helmet shell and ring which prevent exposure to water, and a SuperFlow regulator which provides controlled an easy breathing for the diver. The Superlight is also unique due to its ability to hold specialty items. In this picture, the superlight is equipped with a camera and light. The light is useful for providing illumination in dark depths while the camera is used for research and documentation. These are just a few of the tools used by commercial divers – many of which are on display in the exhibit.\nAquanaut Dewey Smith’s Kirby Morgan\nSadly, the helmet in the exhibit once belonged to aquanaut Dewey Smith – a research diver at the nearby Aquarius Reef Base. Dewey lost his life in May of 2009 due to a re-breather malfunction. His helmet was donated to the museum by his parents in his memory, and serves as a poignant reminder of the ever-present dangers involved in the field of commercial diving.\nADCI HOF (Association of Diving Contractors International Hall of Fame)\nAlso located in the exhibit is the Commercial Diving Hall of Fame Monument. The CDHoF was established in 2003, nominating and inducting divers that have made a substantial contribution to the field of Commercial Diving. The monument can be seen in the History of Diving Museum year round with the exception of the annual induction ceremony in New Orleans when it is crated up and shipped to Louisiana.\nYou’ll see all this and more when you visit the History of Diving Museum, explore the Commercial Diving exhibit and immerse yourself in hundreds of years of diving history! -Jon\nPost navigation\n← Previous Post\nNext Post →\nFollow/Like Us on YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram for daily updates and recordings of prior presentations.\nHistory Of Diving Museum\n82990 Overseas Hwy, Islamorada, FL 33036\n(305) 664-9737\ninfo@divingmuseum.org\nHours Open 10-5 Daily\nOpen Captioned, Close Captioned and Wheelchair accessible\nThe History of Diving Museum is an independent, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization.

It’s a bit like driving an 18-wheel truck versus taking a scenic drive on holiday.\nDoes that mean professional divers like scuba instructors and divemasters are commercial divers? Good question. Even though PADI ® Pros get paid to dive, they are not considered commercial divers in most countries.\nAs the name suggests, commercial divers do things related to commerce such as: welding, salvage and maintaining underwater infrastructure. They often dive in rough conditions (strong currents, extreme depths, bad visibility) and stay down for a few hours. Compare this to a recreational dive, which should never exceed 40 m/130 ft.\nCommercial divers:\nWear specialized equipment\nReceive different training\nDive places recreational divers should never go\nWhat is Commercial Diving?\nCommercial diving is a broad term that describes a variety of occupations. Some commercial divers work offshore on oil rigs, while others dive in local lakes and rivers. Here are some of the most common commercial diving jobs:\nDrinking Water Assessment\nHAZMAT : Diving in polluted water\nInspection : Checking underwater cables, pipelines or bridge pylons for signs of damage\nPublic Safety Diving\nSalvage : Recovering items or entire vessels\nUnderwater Construction and Maintenance : Including bridges, dams and other infrastructure\nUnderwater Demolition\nAs mentioned above, commercial divers use different equipment than recreational divers. Many don’t even wear scuba tanks. Some dive with rebreathers , but most get their breathing gas from a surface-supplied breathing apparatus.\nThe majority of commercial divers wear some type of full face mask with an integrated device that allows them to communicate with other divers and/or a team at the surface. Depending on the job and the conditions, they may wear a mask that covers their entire face but leaves the top and back of their head exposed OR a helmet that covers their entire head. This is sometimes called hard hat diving.\nCommercial divers often work long shifts in extreme conditions. Because of this, commercial diving can be among the most high-paying jobs for scuba divers .\nSaturation Diving\nSome commercial divers spend weeks underwater. They live inside a pressurized chamber so they can work at extreme depths. The video below includes interviews with saturation divers working at 180 m/590 ft.\nCommercial Diving vs. Technical Diving\nThe line between commercial diving and technical diving can be blurry. Both commercial and technical divers stay underwater for extended periods and dive below the recreational limit. They may also use similar equipment, such as rebreathers and full face masks. Lastly, both commercial and technical divers complete specialized training to prepare for diving in more challenging environments.\nThe difference between these two types of diving comes down to:\nTechnical divers explore for fun and choose where they want to dive\nCommercial divers get paid and don’t choose where they dive\nLearn More About Technical Diving\nInterested in a Commercial Scuba Diving Career?\nLearn more about what it takes to become a commercial diver .

The diving reflex is a natural response that every person possess. It is also known as the Diving Response or the Bradycardic Response.\nThe diving reflex mechanism is a response to immersion of all known air-breathing vertebraes. As vertebraes, mammals have this reflex too, which means, you the reader, have it.\nDiscovery of the diving reflex\nEver since the scientific world accepted Boyle's law, scientist calculated that diving thirty meters (100ft) were impossible. Under Boyle's Law, the deeper we dive underwater, the higher the pressure. For decades, scientists thought that this high pressure would compress the air in our body and crush our lungs.\nBut in 1949, two Italian divers proved this theory wrong. Ennio Falco dared Raimondo Bucher (who was also a spearfisher) to dive the limit for 50,000 Lira ($800). Lt. Bucher plunged the thirty meters (100 ft) and won the bet. This feat brought awareness among the scientific community and led them to study more about human physiology.\nIn 1962, the Swedish physiologist, Scholander discovered the secret of this mechanism. By strapping heart rate monitors to volunteer divers, he found out that these divers had their heart slowed down when they dive.\nHow does the diving reflex happen?\nThe human body will conserve the air supply it has when immersed in water. When your body senses that the face is getting wet, it will automatically keep the oxygen inside, and your blood will be moved to your heart and brain.\nWe have this response even at an early stage of our lives. When you dip a baby in water, it will close its throat to prevent the air from escaping the body and keeping water or anything else out.\nAquatic mammals like the dolphins and whales, even the hippopotamus, are more adept in using their diving reflex. Evolution made their physiology more suited to such conditions.\nWhat triggers the diving reflex?\nThe diving reflex occurs because of the immersion of the body in water. The need for air made our body more conscious of oxygen consumption. It results in a decrease in heart rate to lessen the oxygen consumption.\nStudies found that the diving reflex only works if your face is wet or immersed in water. Scientists have tried simulating different situations with different stimuli but to no avail. Only immersion trigger the mammalian diving response.\nOur body responds that way without knowing why it should. It means that the diving reflex is instinctive. But the reflex can become voluntary if you practice on controlling it.\nIn 1976, the French diver, Jacques Mayol left the world in awe when he dove down to 100 meters underwater (330ft) for the first time. His introduction of yoga to the new sport of freediving gave freedivers the possibility to go deeper.\nThe changes in the body due to the Reflex\nWhen the diving response kicks in, the body adapts temporarily to being immersed in water. It means that our body will not function the way it usually does.\nIt starts with a Bradycardia which involves the slowing of the pace of the heart — followed by the Peripheral Vasoconstriction. The second change constricts blood flow and oxygen consumption. Finally, there will be a blood shift. The shift causes blood plasma from different parts of the body to move to the chest cavity. It is to protect the organs in the chest.\nThese changes allow the human body to stay longer underwater. It also makes sure that no damage is done even with the deprivation of air.\nThe benefits of enhancing the diving reflex\nPracticing to control your diving response can contribute to your health. The diving response makes our body adaptive to conditions where air becomes limited. Your body will function normally even under a similar situation.\nScholander's experiment on divers showed that we could dive deep without the help of any gears. As the divers controlled their breathing, the researchers figured the possibility of treating anxiety.\nBy practicing apnea, our breathing becomes more controlled, even when our body is lacking in air, we can remain calm.\nThe Diving Reflex Researches and References\nAll pictures used for this article are courtesy of Wikimedia Commons and our freediving staff.\nIf you want to know more about sirens and mermaids, take a look at some of our references below.\nMammalian Diving Response\nDiving & health\nButcher Raimondo\nScience of Freediving\nPhysiology of Freediver\nAn Enigmatic Reflex to Preserve Life?\nDiving Reflex\nCold Shock Response\nSpeaking about Mammalian Diving Reflex, do you how deep can a mammal go on a single breath?\nLast, but not Least\nIf you would like to receive interesting content like this in your email Inbox, subscribe to our newsletter.

It has a parking lot, bathrooms and dive tables for assembling your equipment. You’ll need to walk along a 150-foot path through the jungle to get to the cenote. There is no nearby store to buy food or drinks and no showers. But, once there, you will see stairs and a small platform for easy access to the water. No jumps are required here. But you do need to be cautious with your dive equipment .\n \n \nCenote Angelita Facts\nInfo\nHow to get to the cenote\nGoing south from Tulum on high way 307 to Chetumal about 15 km on the left side, look for a big rock on the right side about 13 km from Tulum you are getting close.\nIs it Suitable for Snorkeling\nYes\nIs it Suitable for Scuba Diving\nYes\nIs it Suitable for Cavern & Cave Diving\nYes\nWater entrance\nEasy by a ladder\nMax Depth:\n60m but we only dive down to 35m\nDive Certification required:\nAdvance open water\nWater temperature:\n25°C all year round\nDive Highlights\nEerie hydrogen sulfur cloud thicker than 3 meters at 25m depth, looking like a spooky underwater river, the island debris of giant trees coming from the cloud, the Angel stalagmite, some big stalactites\nHalocline at\n28m\nWhat can be seen there:\nSometimes a crocodile at the entrance\nVisitors numbers:\nnon-crowded\nRestaurants nearby:\nyes\nPublic toilets & showers nearby:\nyes\nThis cenote is 180 feet deep. With us, you’ll dive down to 120 feet. This cenote is particularly well known because of its crazy hydrogen sulfur cloud at 100 feet is about 9 feet thick. At 98 feet you encounter the halocline. It’s one of the most bizarre dives you can do in your life. You are going to see lots of fallen trees which rise out of the cloud, a little island with branches.\nThe average total time is 40 minutes underwater. While in the cenote you will see a couple of stalactites, a tunnel that has a swim through and, if you pay close attention, you are going to see bird bones, branches, trees and many other things which have fallen into the cenote. Angelita is one of the most beautiful cenotes around Tulum , absolutely brimming with interesting things to see.\nHow to get to Cenote Angelita\nThe cenote is located 17 kilometres south of Tulum on the road to Chetumal. It’s very clearly signposted. After you arrive you only need to walk through the jungle for a few minutes to find the sinkhole, which looks like a picturesque little lake surrounded by trees. The path leads directly to it and there is easy access now provided by the stairs and a platform.\nCenote Angelita diving – the experience\nYou will need to be an advanced diver to get the full Cenote Angelita diving experience. It offers something truly unique even compared to the many other fascinating cenotes on the Yucatan peninsula but it is very deep indeed. The dense hydrogen sulfate cloud which separates the fresh water above from the salt water below creates a one-of-a-kind effect which really has to be seen to be believed.\n \n  \n \nDiving here with Ko’ox is a deep 1-tank dive which lasts 40 minutes. The water temperature is usually a little over 25°C.\nWe will provide you with all the necessary equipment for this dive: complete dive gear, 5mm wetsuit, torch and a Go Pro camera.\nCertification: you need to have advanced open water certification.\nCheck the prices for Cenote Adventures\nCenotes – from Tulum\nPrice\nDuration\nGet this tour\n2 Cenote Dives from Tulum\n204USD\n8am – 1:30pm\nBook Now\n🌿Tulum’s Best for certified divers: 1 Cenote Dive + 1 Ocean Dive 🐠\n174USD\n8am – 1:30pm\nBook Now\n🌿Best for non-divers: Discover Scuba Diving Casa Cenote + Snorkel Dos Ojos 🌿\n214USD\n8am – 1:30pm\nBook Now\nDiscover Scuba Diving 2 dives: 1 Cenote + 1 Ocean Dive from Tulum\n214USD\n8am – 1:30pm\nBook Now\nFull Open water course: 5 Dives + E-learning from Tulum\n564USD\n3 days\nBook Now\nOpen Water Diver Course + 2 Dives in Dos Ojos from Tulum + E-learning\n684USD\n3 days\nBook Now\nAdvanced Open Water Diver Course from Tulum + E-learning\n564USD\n3 days\nBook Now\n1 Cave dive from Tulum\n204USD\n8am – 1:30pm\nBook Now\n2 Cave dives from Tulum\n264USD\n8am – 3:30pm\nBook Now\n2 Cenotes Snorkel: Dos Ojos & Casa Cenote from Tulum\n124USD\n8am – 12:30pm\nBook Now\n2 Snorkel Locations from Tulum\n124USD\n8am – 12:30pm\nBook Now\n1 Cenote Fun Freedive from Tulum\n144USD\n8am – 12pm\nBook Now\n2 Cenote Fun Freedives from Tulum\n214USD\n8am – 2pm\nBook Now\nSSI Discovery Freediving – 1 dive\n154USD\n8am – 12pm\nBook Now\n🐊Crocodile Night Dive Cenote Tour from Tulum🐊\n214USD\n6:30pm-10pm\nBook Now\n🐊Crocodile Night Snorkel Cenote Tour from Tulum🐊\n164USD\n6:30pm-10pm\nBook Now\n \nCenotes – from Playa del Carmen\nPrice\nDuration\nGet this tour\n👌🏼Full Day Adventure: Best of Playa del Carmen Cenotes – 3 Dives🌴\n267USD\n8am – 4:30pm\nBook Now\n2 Cenote Dives from Playa\n204USD\n8am – 2:30pm\nBook Now\n🌿Playa Del Carmen’s Best for certified divers: Cenote & Ocean 🐠\n174USD\n8am – 1pm\nBook Now\n🌿Best for non-divers: Discover Scuba Diving Casa Cenote + Snorkel Dos Ojos🌿\n214USD\n8am – 2pm\nBook Now\nDiscover Scuba Diving: 1 Cenote Dive + 1 Ocean Dive from Playa\n214USD\n8am – 1:30pm\nBook Now\nFull Open water course – 5 Dives + E-learning\n564USD\n2-3 days\nBook Now\nAdvanced Open Water Diver Course from Playa + E-learning\n564USD\n3 days\nBook Now\n2 Snorkel Locations Tour from Playa\n124USD\n8am – 12:30pm\nBook Now\n1 Cenote Fun Freedive from Playa\n144USD\n8am-12pm\nBook Now\n2 Cenote Fun Freedives from Playa\n214USD\n8am-2pm\nBook Now\nSSI Discovery Freediving – 1 dive\n154USD\n8am – 12pm\nBook Now\n🐊Crocodile Night Dive Cenote Tour from Playa🐊\n214USD\n6:30pm-10pm\nBook Now\n🐊Crocodile Night Snorkel Cenote Tour from Playa🐊\n164USD\n6:30pm-10pm\nBook Now\n \nCenotes – from Puerto Aventuras\nPrice\nDuration\nGet this tour\n👌🏼Full Day Adventure: Best of Puerto Aventuras Cenotes – 3 Dives🌴\n267USD\n8am – 4:30pm\nBook Now\n2 Cenote Dives from Puerto Aventuras\n204USD\n8am – 2:30pm\nBook Now\n1 Cenote Dive from Puerto Aventuras\n174USD\n1:30pm-4:30pm\nBook Now\nDiscover Scuba Diving: 1 Cenote Dive + 1 Ocean Dive from Puerto Aventuras\n214USD\n8am – 1:30pm\nBook Now\nDiscover Scuba Diving: 1 Cenote Dive from Puerto Aventuras\n154USD\n8am – 1:30pm\nBook Now\nFull Open Water Course: 5 Dives + E-learning\n564USD\n2-3 days\nBook Now\nAdvanced Open Water Diver Course + E-learning\n564USD\n3 days\nBook Now\n2 Snorkel Locations Tour from Puerto Aventuras\n124USD\n8am – 12:30pm\nBook Now\n🐊Crocodile Night Dive Cenote Tour from Puerto Aventuras🐊\n214USD\n6:30pm-10pm\nBook Now\nGet a Quote\nView All Tours\n1-4 people small group visits – every day\nCave diving certification is required for cave diving\nFor private tours, please contact us, so we can provide an exclusive offer for you.\nPrices include:\nTransportation from our dive shop in Tulum or Playa del Carmen or Puerto Aventuras\nHigh-quality dive equipment rental: full dive gear set and torches\nPrices are fixed, regardless of the number of people in the group.\n \nDive time: 35 to 40 minutes\nDepth: 120 feet\nTemperature: 78 degrees Fahrenheit\nTanks: 1\nCertification: Advanced open water or show proof that you have done deep dives, or 2 star\nBathrooms: Yes, ecological\nParking: Yes\nEntrance fee: Yes\nSnorkeling: Yes, but not much to see\nThe topography of the cavern\nThe Cenote Angelita cave has no tunnels besides a couple of small swim-throughs. It is essentially one large cavern, edged by some stalactites, which descends to around 180 feet in depth. That’s a lot further down than you’ll usually go, though. The really amazing views are all tied to the effects created by the halocline and the hydrogen sulfate cloud which hovers at around 100 feet.\n \n \nDip beneath the cloud and you will see a truly bizarre effect. The change from fresh water to salt water makes it look as if you are floating in the air above a river bed. You can take a look at some photos to get the idea. But really experiencing it in person is something else entirely!\nThe surface From the surface, Cenote Angelita doesn’t look like much more than a very pleasant pool. But beneath the waters, it’s got it where it counts. There is a small selection of marine life which can often be seen from near the surface. The most popular residents are undoubtedly the crocodiles.\nThe light and the cloud The light shining down through the pool makes the freshwater section of the cavern very clear indeed. There is very good visibility, though the cloud beneath you can give the cavern a slightly creepy, eerie look. When you are floating in the depths, look up towards the light and you will see the mesmerising optical show which Mexico’s water-filled caverns are best known for. The light filters down between the roots and trees above is splintered by the water and seems to fall down towards you in a sparkling haze of beams.\nThe bottom The true bottom of the cenote is very deep indeed. However, as you descend you won’t be able to escape the feeling that the cloud layer is the bottom. The branches of sunken trees emerge from it like dead fingers beckoning you deeper. If another diver emerges through it as you watch, remember to keep your mask in place despite the shock.\nDeeper diving For deeper diving in Angelita Cenote, you will need your lights. Especially when you get down beneath the hydrogen sulfate layer. Dipping beneath that layer can be nerves-inducing the first time, but it’s more than worth it to get the true experience of swimming in this most unusual of cenotes.\nCenote FAQ\nQ. How deep is the cenote? A. This cenote is 180 feet deep. Generally, you will only dive to 120 feet.\nQ. What time of day is best for a Cenote Angelita dive? A. It’s open from 8 am to 5 pm every day of the week. Any time between the mid-morning and mid-afternoon will probably be better because the sun will be shining down from directly overhead. If you want some advice as to when to go, ask in the Ko’ox shop before you head out.\nQ. Is the cenote fresh water or salt water? A. This cenote contains both. They meet at a layer called the halocline, which creates intriguing lighting effects. This effect is partly concealed by the hydrogen sulfate cloud here. But the cloud creates fascinating effects all of its own!\nQ. Can I bring a camera? A. To capture the jaw-dropping optical effects here it’s highly recommended that you bring a camera. Ko’ox will even provide you with a Go Pro, which you should request prior to your dive and thus capture your experience properly!\nGet a Quote\nBook Now\nDiscover\nCenotes\nOcean & Reef\nCultural Tours\nScuba Diving Tulum\nPlaya Del Carmen\nCozumel\nCancun\nLa Paz B.C.S\nHelp & Info\nAbout us\nFranchise Opportunity\nJoin us\nCourses\nStay\nReviews\nSeaweed Report\nPrivacy Policy\nContact Us\nBlog\nContact Us\nWhatsApp Tulum, Cancun, Cozumel, Puerto Aventuras, La Paz\n+52 1 984 141 5502\nCall KO'OX Diving Office\n+52 1 984 141 5502\nContact Us\nOpen every day: from 7:30AM to 9PM\nCall KO'OX Diving Cancun\n+52 1 984 141 5502\nCall KO'OX Diving Cozumel\n+52 1 984 141 5502\nCall KO'OX Puerto Aventuras\n+52 1 984 141 5502\nCall KO'OX Diving La Paz, B.C.S\n+52 1 984 141 5502\nTours and courses by certified dive masters & tour guides speaking English, Spanish and French.\nSocial Media\nWe accept\n© Koox Diving 2021\n🌴 Explore the Cenotes & 🐊Croc Dive & 🐢Akumal & 🐟Try Spearfishing\nClose GDPR Cookie Settings\nPrivacy Overview\nStrictly Necessary Cookies\n3rd Party Cookies\nCookie Policy\nPowered by  GDPR Cookie Compliance\nPrivacy Overview\nThis website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user experience possible.

Drysuits seal off outside water with silicone, latex, or neoprene seals, dry zippers, and special valves and can be filled with air or argon to add more thermal insulation. Drysuits are often used in water temperatures below 15°C (60°F), as well as when diving for extended durations in technical and cave diving.\nFrequent cold water diving is probably the most common reason why divers move on to buying a drysuit after using a wetsuit at first.\nI like to call drysuits, especially membrane ones, “big, fancy underwater plastic bags” that keep you dry and help you float.\nIt is true that using a good drysuit can further improve your buoyancy and give you much better trim underwater.\nTypes of drysuits\nThere are three types of drysuits available:\nCrushed Neoprene Drysuits\nMembrane / Trilaminate Drysuits\nProprietary Materials Drysuits\nCrushed Neoprene\nCrushed neoprene drysuits were the first type of drysuits available and are made of neoprene used in wetsuits…but highly crushed or compressed.\nSuch compression makes the suit thinner (imagine a 14mm neoprene suit without compression…), waterproof, and less buoyant.\nThe biggest benefits of crushed neoprene drysuits are that they provide thermal insulation and protection on their own, while being form-fitted and often relatively small in size.\nMoreover, these types of drysuits are usually cheaper than other kinds.\nMembrane / Trilaminate Drysuits\nMembrane drysuits are often referred to as trilaminate drysuits (tri = three, laminate = layers) and are often the preferred choice by cave divers, technical divers, and dive instructors.\nThey are much thinner than neoprene drysuits and more flexible. However, they offer almost no thermal protection which is why we wear thick undergarments underneath to stay warm.\nMembrane or (tri)laminate suits are more flexible…at a higher price.\nThe biggest advantages of trilaminate drysuits are the flexibility to work in any water temperature and environment, lightweight, the strength of the material, and lower packing volume.\nAdditionally, they are highly customizable and easier to fix.\nThe downside to that is a much (!) higher price, the need to almost always wear extra undergarments, and higher maintenance effort.\nProprietary Materials Drysuits\nWhen looking for a drysuit you might sometimes come across some extra materials manufacturers use to make their drysuits. They sometimes come with fancy names such as Octolaminate, Cordura, High-Density neoprene, etc.\nIn essence, while these materials surely have benefits and add extra strength and thermal protection, they are ultimately still types of crushed neoprene or membrane drysuits.\nBuying a drysuit\nBuying a drysuit can be a bit more complicated than buying a wetsuit , shorty, or rash guard since there are a lot more things to consider and keep in mind.\nJulius, the founder of Social Diving, in his favorite drysuit.\nSet a budget for your drysuit\nLet’s not deny it, drysuits are an expensive piece of diving equipment and they require quite an investment. Most drysuits are priced above $1,500 or even much higher, so be prepared to spend at least that.\nAlso, don’t forget that you will need dry boots , dry gloves, extra LP(low pressure) hoses, undergarments, extra weights, and other things to use your drysuit underwater.\nSet a budget for yourself that you will stick to and then start looking in that price range.\nAs always give yourself a small(!) margin in case you find something a little above the initial budget that would be perfect for you.\nNeoprene vs Membrane Drysuit\nYou read about the differences between neoprene and membrane or laminate drysuits above.\nNow the question is: Which one to pick?\nIn my opinion, if you are on a very tight budget, but still need a drysuit for coldwater diving, get a budget crushed-neoprene drysuit which will save you a lot of money while still performing well.\nThe same goes if you only dive in one location or water temperature, and you know exactly that the drysuit you’re buying will be warm enough. It will be much easier to use the drysuit and not get hung up on undergarments or such.\nOn the other hand, if you plan on diving in very different types of waters, visit different locations frequently or live at a place where the water temperature varies a lot throughout the year, I highly recommend a trilaminate or membrane drysuit.\nThey are much more flexible underwater, allow you to change the thermal layers inside to what is required, and are generally much more versatile in their usage.\nIf you are a technical or cave diver, I also highly suggest you go for a high-quality trilaminate drysuit as they offer much better buoyancy, extensibility, and maneuverability than neoprene ones.\nSocks vs Boots\nUnlike wetsuits, drysuits completely encapsulate the diver and do not let water in at the feet.\nMost drysuits, therefore, come with socks or boots attached that are made of either neoprene, silicone, or latex.\nBoth have advantages and disadvantages so pick carefully.\nSocks are usually made out of the same material as the rest of the drysuit and are thin, not super sturdy, and are meant to be used in combination with extra boots.\nFor this purpose, rock boots or dry boots are most common, which are essentially really thick diving boots. The biggest benefit of them is that they are replaceable (whereas a torn drysuit sock requires a complete suit repair) and extra warm.\nPick carefully whether you want socks or boots attached to your drysuit.\nSome drysuits come with boots attached instead of socks. They are much sturdier and more durable than socks, however, not as much as external rock boots.\nDrysuits with boots are often a little less expensive than buying drysuits with socks and extra boots. The disadvantage is that, similar to broken socks, they require a full suit repair once they break.\nFront Zip vs Back Zip for drysuit?\nDrysuits are equipped with a dry zip that’s either located on the front, called a front zip, or on the back of the suit, naturally referred to as a back zip. Similar to wetsuits, front zips are easier to open and close by yourself, whereas with a back zip, you need help from your dive buddy to close it. In return, they make the suit look more streamlined and aren’t in the way of any instruments.\nI personally always go for front zips and it’s what the majority of drysuits use nowadays.\nBeing a dive instructor, I usually don’t get much help putting my scuba gear on and off and it’s much quicker to do it by myself.\nMoreover, if there was ever an emergency and I needed to get out of the suit super quickly, a front zip has clear advantages.\nFront zips are usually advantageous for most divers.\nMetal or plastic zipper for a drysuit?\nDrysuits come with either a metal or plastic dry zipper attached. Metal zippers are generally a little more sturdy than plastic zippers. However, they are less resistant to being, require more maintenance and care, and are heavier and less flexible. Most drysuit manufacturers recommend plastic zippers nowadays as they show clear advantages over older metal zipper configurations.\nI personally always go with plastic zippers and haven’t ever regretted the decision.\nThey are just so much easier to handle and let’s be honest…if you’re ever in a situation where the plastic zipper breaks due to impact or sheer forces……you probably have to worry about many worse things than a zipper tooth breaking.\nI recommend plastic zippers in most cases.\nWhat Should I Wear Under A Drysuit?\nWhat you wear under your drysuit depends on the water temperature, as well as the type of drysuit you’re using. For warm neoprene drysuits, thick skiing underwear is usually enough to stay warm. When using thinner membrane and trilaminate drysuits, divers wear special drysuit undergarments between 100mm – 700mm in thickness, thick skiing underwear, and socks to stay warm underwater. The colder the water temperature, and the longer the dive, the more thermal layers you need to wear under your drysuit.\nAs we already saw, crushed and high-density neoprene drysuits are much thicker than other types and offer plenty of thermal protection and insulation on their own.\nTherefore, you usually get by with less underneath to stay warm, unless you dive in extremely cold water or under ice.\nLong skiing underwear, a fleece jacket, thick socks, or double layers are recommended.\nWe usually wear thick undergarments underneath our membrane drysuits.\nIf you choose to buy a membrane or trilaminate drysuit which both offer more flexibility but are much thinner, you will need more thermal layers underneath.\nIn most cases, it is recommended to buy special drysuit undergarments between 100mm – 700mm in thickness as they are the perfect size for a drysuit and are usually extremely lightweight.\nI usually wear skiing socks underneath as my feet tend to get rather cold quickly.\nShould I buy a custom-fit Drysuit?\nSimilar to tailored suits, custom-fit or made-to-measure drysuits fit much better than those with standard sizes, are perfect for your specific body type and\nDrysuits for Scuba Diving\nBest Scuba Diving Drysuits in 2024\nWhat is a drysuit?\nTypes of drysuits\nBuying a drysuit\nFront Zip vs Back Zip for drysuit?\nWhat Should I Wear Under A Drysuit?\nShould I buy a custom-fit Drysuit?\nMake the most out of every dive\nJoin more than 21,300 readers on our email list for more tips & tricks!

This number has been steadily increasing in recent years and by now, about 40-50% of all our Open Water Diver students at Social Diving are women.\nThis percentage also largely depends on demographic factors and from my own experience as a dive instructor, there are many more female scuba divers in Germany than in other countries around the world.\n35% of all divers are female, but the number is rising.\nAre Women Better Scuba Divers than Men?\nNo, women and men are equally as good at scuba diving. Women tend to have better air management than men and use less air while scuba diving, mostly because they breathe less and their lung capacity is often smaller. Women often reach good buoyancy faster than their male counterparts, however, with experience, this effect is often reversed.\nThese are my own observations from working and diving with thousands of divers around the world, as well as those of other dive instructors and professionals. While not technically better than men, women often have a different style while scuba diving.\nAlthough it may sound stereotypical and I cannot (and will not) generalize this statement, in my experience, men tend to have better navigational skills underwater.\nWomen are not better scuba divers, but different.\nLast but not least, men and women observe their environments very differently from each other. Whenever I speak to my fellow divers during the debriefing, it almost feels like we did two separate dives.\nThis is neither positive, nor negative, but shows the diversity in diving and why we definitely need more women in scuba diving!\nBest Websites Dedicated to Women in Scuba Diving\nThere are many blogs, websites, and other channels dedicated to women in scuba diving. And even if you are a guy, these are worth checking out. The best ones, in my opinion, are:\nwww.girlsthatscuba.com\nGirls that Scuba is a community site for female divers around the world to connect, dive and travel together. They have a large following on social media and are definitely worth checking out.\nwww.wdhof.org\nThe Women Divers Hall of Fame recognizes achievements by women in scuba diving. It’s a great site to read up on some remarkable women in scuba diving and their stories.\nscubadiverlife.com\nScuba Diver Life is one of the largest scuba diving-related sites out there and entirely female-led. Their focus is not on women in scuba diving but it shows that women definitely make an impact on the diving world.\nFamous Women in Scuba Diving\nLet’s take a moment to recognize some truly remarkable and famous women in scuba diving and how they have shaped the world of diving in their own way.\nNaturally, writing about all they have done would require an article of its own for each person, so this is just to give you some inspiration.\nWhen reading up on famous women in scuba diving, it is interesting that a few of them were unfortunately overshadowed by their husbands or male dive partners (think of Cousteau or Hass), albeit achieving great things on their own.\nDr. Sylvia Earle\nDr. Sylvia Earle is a world-renowned marine biologist, scuba diver, and holder of several diving records .\nAmong them is the deepest walk on the seafloor . She is a National Geographic Society Explorer and just the list of her honors and accomplishments is longer than most people’s entire resume.\nDr. Sylvia Earle scuba diving in the 1990s.\nTruly an icon among marine biologists and scientists of any field, Dr. Sylvia Earle should be a name to be recognized among the likes of Jacques-Yves Cousteau, Hans Hass, or Eugene Clark.\nHere is one of my favorite diving quotes by her:\nWhy is it that scuba divers and surfers are some of the strongest advocates of ocean conservation? Because they’ve spent time in and around the ocean, and they’ve personally seen the beauty, the fragility, and even the degradation of our planet’s blue heart.\nDr. Sylvia Earle\nDottie Frazier\nWhile not nearly as famous as some of the other names out there, Dottie Frazier was truly a pioneer of scuba diving.\nThought to be the first female scuba diving instructor in the world, and subsequently the first scuba diving shop owner, as well. Mind you, this was in 1955, at a time when the sport of scuba diving was still in its infancy and almost entirely dominated by men.\nShe was inducted into the Women Divers Hall of Fame in 2000 .\nFrazier passed away in February 2022, and the New York Times dedicated a featured article to her life accomplishments.\nValerie Taylor\nBorn in 1935 in Sydney, Australia, Valerie Taylor is arguably best known for her role in the movie Jaws.\nWhat’s often forgotten, however, are her tremendous achievements as a conservationist, filmmaker, and underwater photographer. Did you know, for example, that she was the first person to film a great white shark (without a cage) in the open sea?\nShe and her husband together also documented and recorded the Great Barrier Reef, diving its entire length in the process. To put this into perspective, that’s 2,300 km (1,400 mi) of diving.\nDr. Eugenie Clark\nAlso known as the “Shark Lady” Dr. Eugenie Clark was another world-famous scuba diver and marine biologist.\nShe wrote two books and 175(!) articles on sharks and conservation throughout her career spanning nearly 70 years. Her list of honors and accolades is worth reading and she did her last scuba dive aged 92 !\nDr. Eugenie Clark\nHow cool is that?\nFemale Diving Records\nLet’s look at a collection of the best female (scuba) diving records.\nDeepest scuba dive by a woman\nThe deepest scuba dive by a woman was 236.04 meters, achieved by Karen van den Oever in 2021 in South Africa.\nLongest open saltwater scuba dive by a woman\nThe longest open saltwater scuba dive by a woman was 51 hrs and 25 minutes long, achieved by Cristi Quill in 2015 in the United States.\nDeepest Freedive by a woman (no limit)\nThe deepest freedive by a woman was 160 meters, achieved by Tanya Streeter in 2002 in the Turks and Caicos Islands.\nWhy Women are Great Dive Buddies\nLast but not least, I would like to give you a few reasons why women are great dive buddies, and I personally always enjoy diving with them.\nNo stereotypes, just observations…take them with a little wink. 😉\nAlways on time\nTheir diving gear is always prepared well in advance\nMore safety concious than guys\nDiving bad always tidily packed\nThey never “forget” dirty socks in a bag for weeks\nGreat environmental awareness underwater\nLess lead weights to carry\nThere are probably even more advantages than I listed here. However, these are some of my favorites why you should have girls in your diving group!\nMixed diving groups are the most fun!\nIf you are still looking for a dive buddy, check out these 7 ways to find a dive buddy .\nConclusion\nHopefully, this article gave you a little inspiration on women and scuba diving. It shows that our sport is becoming more diverse every year and people recognize the achievements of both men and women.\nDo you know some inspirational women in scuba diving?

Of course, you’ll need to pack shirts, pants, underwear, and so on, as well.\nHow to pack for a dive trip?\nAlthough the past months have not been the best for diving trips, 2024 is bound to be great for scuba divers!\nPacking for a diving trip is a little different than packing for a beach vacation or city trip. Obviously, you will need clothes and other travel items, as usual. In addition, surprise surprise, you will take your scuba gear (if you own any).\nSometimes you have to be creative when packing for a diving vacation.\nHowever, don’t just bring everything you have and try to make it fit in your suitcase just to end up with overweight charges at the airport.\nInstead, ask yourself a number of important questions related to the specific location you’re traveling to and the kind and amount of diving you’ll do there.\nFor example, “ how many spare batteries for your computer are necessary? ” and “ do you really need a sweater in Egypt in the summer? “.\nI have done some quite extensive traveling in my life, both for scuba and non-scuba diving activities and the most important lesson I have learned was: Less is more when packing for a dive trip!\nLess is more when packing for a dive trip!\nIn general, there are only a few things that must not be forgotten, and they usually aren’t even connected to scuba diving at all. Passport, credit cards, visa, underwear…you get the point.\nThe only things you really need in regard to scuba diving are your logbook, your dive insurance card, and your scuba certification card.\nThe rest can always be bought, rented, or borrowed on-site, even last-minute. Trust me, you’re not the first diver (and won’t be the last either) who forgets a mask, dive computer, or couldn’t fit their BCD into the suitcase.\nDiving trip operators know this and prepare accordingly. 😉\nOh, and yes, you DO need a sweater in Egypt, even in the summer and two spare batteries are usually sufficient for any given trip.\nImportant questions to ask before a diving trip\nHere are some things I ask myself before I travel:\nWhat will the weather be like at my destination?\nCheck your weather app on your phone or computer or simply ask the trip operator about the current weather at your destination.\nI will not bother explaining why your packing list might need adjustment depending on the weather.\nHowever, keep in mind that after days of diving you WILL get colder, even if the outside temperatures are super high. This is especially true on multi-day liveaboard safaris.\nWhat kind of accommodation have I booked?\nSome diving camps may only provide shared showers at the lower-priced apartments, while other dive resorts do or do not give you beach towels. Make sure to pack accordingly.\nWill I be on a boat?\nYou will not need shoes on a liveaboard (in fact, some boat operators forbid you from taking them on board in the first place), but you might want to pack some medicine against seasickness, or an extra power bank for charging your devices.\nLiveaboard safaris are fun but require some adjustments to the packing list.\nHow much of my vacation will be spent diving?\nThe more you dive, the less time you will have for other activities…and vice versa. If you travel for one week and booked 5 or 6 diving days (abide by the no-flight times!) you will most likely not need your hiking boots.\nOn the other hand, if you only want to get in a couple of days of diving, consider renting certain pieces of equipment to save space and weight in your suitcase.\nWhat kind of diving will I be doing?\nBoat dives mean you need a surface marker buoy (SMB), which will not be necessary when ice diving in a lake. On the other hand, please leave your drysuit at home if you plan on diving in anything warmer than 24-26°C. 😄\nWhat are my airline’s regulations in regard to (diving) gear?\nSome airlines don’t allow you to take certain pieces of equipment onboard without prior approval or extra fees.\nLi batteries for your underwater camera and underwater torches, large knives, and other special scuba gear parts often cause some issues, especially when you try to bring them in your carry-on (please put the knives in your suitcase).\nIf you need a second suitcase, be aware that many airlines charge extra for diving gear and will require you to check it in at a separate counter.\nWhat kind of valves are in use at my travel destination?\nMake sure to check whether the tank valves at your dive resort or boat are DIN or INT. In case they differ from your own setup, get an adapter or consider renting the regulator (although I don’t recommend you do).\nThere are adapters to connect your DIN regulator to an INT valve like this one.\nIs there anything I absolutely cannot buy at my destination?\nYou can always buy more shirts and swim trunks wherever you go. Are you someone who likes to bring home souvenir shirts? Leave some of your own at home and save space.\nOn the other hand, prescription medicine absolutely needs to go with you, as well as your logbook and scuba certification card!\nWhat could be useful on a dive trip besides scuba gear?\nI like to always bring a few things which have nothing to do with diving but make sure the vacation gets even better.\nEspecially on liveaboard safaris, a small speaker for listening to music is super convenient.\nI always bring two or three extra chargers for myself, guests, and other divers in case they forgot theirs and it does wonders to make you new friends. 😄\nAs you can see…chargers are indispensable on any diving trip! 😃\nAdditionally, it’s always nice to have at least one “nice” outfit in case there is an after-dive party or get-together. Sure, beachwear is convenient, but who doesn’t like to dress up a little more and enjoy the same from their travel companions?\nShould you bring your own dive gear or rent it during your dive trip?\nIt is best to bring essential pieces of your scuba gear on a dive trip yourself, such as a mask, snorkel, fins, regulator, and dive computer. These are light in weight and renting them is often comparably expensive. BCD, suit, and other heavy items should only be taken if you have enough weight available in your suitcase.\nThis is arguably one of the most asked questions before packing for a scuba diving trip.\nSo much so, that I wrote an entire article on whether you should rent or buy scuba gear .\nThere are really three options you have here:\nRent everything and don’t even bother bringing any equipment\nBring everything yourself\nRent only the least expensive items\nRent everything\nIf you own no equipment at all (besides your ABC set), or only one or two extra items, this is the way to go. Simply don’t bother wasting any luggage space and just rent a full kit on site.\nEspecially if you are only a vacation diver and don’t do any more than about 20 dives per year, there is absolutely NO reason to buy a regulator or BCD, as the cost of maintenance itself will be higher every year than just renting it.\nWhat I suggest though, is to have your own ABC set, and your own dive computer. Owning your own ABC set is just more hygienic and dive computers are usually the most expensive items to rent.\nAdditionally, you get to keep your logged dives inside your computer which I find super convenient.\nYour scuba gear will largely decide how you pack for your trip.\nBring everything yourself\nIf you have your own dive equipment at home which is suitable for the kind of diving prevalent at your travel destination, I am a big fan of owning everything yourself.\nNot only can you be sure the equipment is exactly how you want it to be, but it is also more cost-efficient than renting every time.\nLast but not least, renting single pieces like regulators or BCDs is often almost as expensive as renting a full kit, so if you bother bringing any equipment, do it right. 😉\nI also very much enjoy knowing who has previously breathed from my regulator, and finding comfortable rental fins and boots at my shoe size (47/13) is no fun at all.\nRent only the least expensive items\nThe last option is to bring what you can and rent the items with the highest weight-per-euro/dollar ratio.\nLet’s be honest. Packing an ADV-style BCD is no fun (go Backplate & Wing!!!), no matter which brand or size. Whether you own a small or extra-large one is only marginally different and will be annoying.\nTherefore, I strongly believe that renting a cheap BCD is your best bet if you are on a tight weight budget with your luggage.\nSecond are regulators, which are very expensive to purchase and should never be in your suitcase. If you want to bring it, put it into your carry-on item so it does not get stolen or lost.\nAgain, I advise you to buy your own computer and ABC set, which can be used in any case, even if you are not even scuba diving the entire trip.\nMask , snorkel, and fins are simply the base equipment any diver should own, so why not bring it?\nOn average, a computer will cost about 10-20€ per day, so even if you only do 5-10 days of diving every year, you will save money after only your second trip.\nOne thing I rarely bring on trips is a drysuit , especially when taking a plane to get to the destination. It’s just so heavy and takes up a lot of space, I don’t think it is worth the hassle or the money I (don’t) save by bringing it myself.\nConclusion\nI hope this scuba diving packing list helps you as much, as it has helped me through the years!\nIf you know anything that absolutely should go on here, as well, post it in the comments and I will make sure to include it asap.\nJoin the email list to get regular diving tips, tricks, insights, and news straight to your inbox!\nAlways dive with friends and happy bubbles. 😃\nCheers\nJulius\nMake the most out of every dive\nJoin more than 21,300 readers on our email list for more tips & tricks!
